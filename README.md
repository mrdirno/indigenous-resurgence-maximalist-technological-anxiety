## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character 'listens' to a corrupted data-stream from a natural feature (a mountain, a glacier, a forest) and must interpret its error codes as a warning or a message.
- Create a character who is a 'techno-traditional' artisan, crafting vital tools from a fusion of scavenged high-tech components and ancestral materials and methods.
- Imagine a 'convergence' structure—a home, a meeting place, a vehicle—that physically embodies the clash and fusion of worlds. Describe it from the inside.
- Write a dialogue where a elder explains a concept of 'ghosts' or 'spirits' to a tech-savvy younger person, using the behavior of drones, data-packets, or AI as a metaphor.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for Kiona's implant: a non-extractive UI that translates environmental data into song, story, or tactile feedback, respecting data sovereignty.
- Prototype a 'Resilience Network' concept: a decentralized, low-power mesh network protocol that uses the landscape itself (rock formations, water, permafrost) as part of its infrastructure, designed to be invisible to standard scans.
