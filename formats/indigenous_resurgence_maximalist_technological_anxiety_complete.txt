 CHAPTER 1

Kiona’s implant was a week behind on its translation patch, so the river’s data-stream wasn’t singing the old songs anymore—it was spitting error codes in a dead colonial syntax. The council’s new fiber-optic roots, pulsing beneath the bank, had rerouted the ancestral chatter into a raw, screaming feed of satellite debris and forgotten treaties. She could feel the wrongness in her teeth.

She could hear it, the old, wet chuckle under the ice, a sound like stones rolling in a deep pocket. It was the first thaw song, the one that came before the real break-up, when the ice just got porous and sly. It was the most dangerous time to cross. And she was late because the drone had come at dawn, a black, silent wasp hovering at her window, and she’d had to spend an hour calming her grandmother down from the shaking fear of it.

“Tł'ih,” her grandmother had whispered, the old word for ghost, her knuckles white on the tin coffee cup. “They send their tł'ih to watch us now.”

Kiona hadn’t corrected her. A ghost was as good a word as any for a thing that saw without eyes, that carried your face back to people you’d never meet. She’d just drawn the curtain, boiled more spruce tea, and waited until the thing lost interest and slid away over the skeletal tops of the birch trees. Now the sun was a cold coin past its peak, and she had fifteen klicks to go.

She adjusted the pack on her shoulders—a caribou hide frame lashed with sinew, holding three frozen whitefish and a pouch of rendered fat—and studied the ice. It wasn’t white anymore. It was the colour of a dirty sky, webbed with dark veins. Talking ice. She took her tł'ogh from her belt, the long, curved walking stick of moose antler, and tapped it ahead of her. The sound was wrong. Hollow. Hungry.

“Okay,” she said to the river. “Let’s have a conversation.”

Her first steps were a negotiation. The ice groaned, a low, floorboard complaint. She moved not in a line, but in the old pattern her uncle taught her: the ptarmigan walk, shifting weight with a quick, light roll, never letting your whole self commit. The tł'ogh probed, found a soft spot, and she veered left. The wind cut across the open channel, scouring her cheeks, carrying the smell of distant diesel and the closer, cleaner scent of frozen mud and dead willow.

Halfway across, the river spoke clearly.

Krrrr-ack.

Not under her. Ten meters downstream. A black seam opened in the grey skin, and water, blacker still, welled up and smoked in the air. Kiona froze, not in panic, but in calculation. The ice would be shearing along pressure ridges. The sound told her where the weakness was propagating. She was on an island of stability. For now.

She exhaled, her breath a brief ghost of her own. “Still talking,” she murmured. “I’m still listening.”

A high, mechanical whine cut through the wind.

She didn’t look up. Looking up was what they wanted. Acknowledgement. She kept her eyes on the ice, but her periphery caught it: a sleek, carbon-grey quadcopter, lower than the drone, armed with a package pod. A Re-supply Courier. It zipped past her, following the river’s course north, towards the Settlement.

That was new. The couriers usually stuck to the new ice-road grid. The river was for the people who remembered it. The whine faded, replaced by a deeper, more visceral vibration through the soles of her boots. Something big on the ice-road, a few valleys over. A hauler. Bringing what? Taking what?

The questions were a distraction. The ice demanded her whole mind. She pushed them down, found her rhythm again, and reached the far bank just as the sun dipped behind the ragged teeth of the mountains. The snow here was trampled, not by caribou or moose, but by the deep, cleated prints of crawler-treads. The scars were fresh, cutting right through a stand of young spruce, splintering them like bones.

She knelt, not touching the prints, just looking. In the centre of one tread-mark, something glinted. She fished it out with a gloved finger. A data-chip. Standard issue, Settlement logistics. She held it. It was warm. It had fallen recently. It held nothing for her, just strings of numbers that would mean inventory, tonnage, coordinates. A bead of sweat from some operator’s neck. It was also a tiny, perfect eye. It could be pinged. It could tell them where she was.

Kiona considered the river. She drew her arm back to throw it into the black, chewing water.

She stopped.

Her grandmother’s voice, dry as willow leaves: Nothing they make is useless. Everything can be turned.

She slipped the chip into a small, beaded pouch at her belt, the one that held her flint and a pinch of tobacco. It sat there, alien among the ancient things.

The trail from the river to the ridge was a memory, not a path. She followed the hump of land where the blueberries grew thick in summer, avoided the sinkhole where the old bear denned, and climbed the last rocky scramble as the stars began to prick the violet dusk. At the top, the wind died.

Below, in the long valley, the Settlement burned.

Not with fire. With light. A cold, blue-white grid of it, laid out in a perfect, brutal rectangle against the dark land. Sodium arcs turned night into a shadowless, buzzing day over the compound. She could see the blocky shapes of the modular units, the landing pad, the skeletal tower with its blinking red eye. And on the far side, the new excavation: a raw, yellow gash in the earth, lit by banks of floodlights so harsh they seemed to peel the skin off the world. Even from here, she could hear the grind of machinery, a constant, ulcerating hum.

And beside it, almost hidden in the long shadow of the excavation, was the reason for her visit. A darker patch. The last stand of old-growth spruce in the valley, a tight knot of shadow and resilience. Her uncle’s cabin was a smudge at its edge.

That’s where the meeting was. The one she was now very late for.

She descended into the valley, leaving the clean cold of the ridge for the Settlement’s electronic twilight. The air changed. It carried a metallic tang, the smell of crushed rock and ozone. The snow here was grey with dust. She moved from the cover of one scraggly clump of alder to the next, a shadow among shadows. This was the fringe, where the wired world frayed into the old one.

A proximity sensor chirped from a post topped with a swirling blue light. She dropped flat behind a snowdrift. A recorded voice, genderless and calm, floated on the frozen air. “Sector Seven is active. Unauthorized personnel please proceed to the main gate for screening.”

She waited. The light swivelled, bored, and moved on. They were lazy with their perimeter here. They thought the land itself was the barrier. The cold, the distance, the river. They didn’t understand that the land was a road, for those who knew how to walk it.

She circled wide, coming at the spruce grove from the north, from the blind side of the excavation’s glare. The trees rose before her, a sudden wall of stillness. The noise of the machinery faded, absorbed by a million needles. The air softened, smelling of resin and deep, frozen duff. She stepped under the canopy, and the Settlement’s light became a distant, blasphemous glow.

Her uncle’s cabin was not a cabin. It was a convergence. The lower logs were hand-hewn, chinked with moss and clay. The middle section was patched with sheets of scavenged polymer and hull-plating from an old crawler. The roof was layered sod over a membrane of parachute silk. A satellite dish, gutted and rewired, hung from the eaves like a strange metal flower, feeding into a jury-rigged array of car batteries. Smoke, real wood smoke, curled from a stovepipe.

She didn’t knock. The door opened as she reached for it.

Her uncle, Tom, filled the doorway. He was a big man, his face a topography of scars and laugh lines. He wore a faded flannel shirt over a high-tech thermal base layer, caribou hide pants, and mukluks soled with grippy polymer tread from a Re-supply crate.

“The river talk you into a nap?” he grumbled, but his eyes were sharp, checking her over, seeing she was whole.

“A tł'ih paid a visit. Grandmother needed settling.”

He nodded, the one word explaining everything. “Get in. You’re the last.”

The inside was warm, close, and thick with the smell of stew, tobacco, and hot electronics. A dozen people were crowded in, sitting on stools, buckets, the bed frame. Kiona knew them all. Silas, with his hands permanently stained with motor grease. Annie, her hair in a long grey braid, sharpening a ulu knife on a stone. The young ones, Maya and Ben, faces tense with a mix of fear and excitement. They were trappers, hunters, mechanics, the ones who still lived out on the land, in the cracks of the Settlement’s footprint.

All eyes were on the center of the room. On the table.

On the thing growing there.

It was a root. A fat, gnarled taproot from a spruce, washed clean. But it wasn’t just lying there. It was wired. Fine filaments of copper, scavenged from god-knows-where, were wound around it in intricate patterns, connecting to a small solar cell, to a hand-crank generator, to a speaker cobbled together from a headset and a tin can.

Annie saw Kiona looking. “Tom’s latest madness,” she said, but her voice held no mockery.

“It’s not madness,” Tom said, squeezing past Kiona to stand by the table. He placed a hand on the root. “It’s a radio. But not for their voices. For the land’s.”

He nodded to Ben, who nervously took the hand-crank and began to turn it. A low, rhythmic thrum filled the room. The solar cell’s meter flickered. Tom adjusted a wire.

From the speaker, a sound emerged.

It was a hum. A deep, resonant, polyphonic hum. It had rhythm, but not a human one. It pulsed, swelled, faded, like a slow breath. Underneath it were clicks, pops, the faintest suggestion of running water.

“What… is it?” Maya whispered.

“It’s the groundwater,” Tom said, his voice reverent. “The electromagnetic pulse of the water moving through the rock, under the permafrost. The root feels it. The tree feels it. Always has. We just never had a way to hear it before they,” he jerked his head towards the Settlement’s glow, “started filling the world with noise and wires. This…” he tapped the root, “this listens under their noise.”

Kiona felt the sound in her teeth. It was ancient. It was the valley’s heartbeat.

“Why show us this, Tom?” Silas asked, his voice practical. “It’s a wonder. But we didn’t come here for wonders. The diggers are two hundred meters from the burial ridge. They’ve marked the spruce grove here for ‘biomass clearance’ next week. They’re not listening to groundwater. They’re listening for ore.”

Tom’s face hardened. “This is why.” He stopped the crank. The hum died, leaving the room feeling empty, thin. “They map the land with lasers and sonar. They see rock, density, profit. We need to map it with this.” He held up the wired root. “We need to show them the land isn’t empty. That it’s alive. On its own terms. In a language their instruments are deaf to.”

“They’ll say it’s static,” Ben said, discouraged. “They’ll say it’s a trick.”

“Then we make it a truth they can’t ignore,” Kiona said. Her voice was quiet, but it cut through the doubt. All heads turned to her. She was the youngest adult there, but she had her grandmother’s way of speaking—few words, each one placed with care. She pulled the warm data-chip from her pouch, held it up. It caught the lamplight. “They drop these. They’re everywhere. Their whole world runs on them. What if their machines started hearing our world? What if their maps started singing our songs?”

A slow smile spread across Tom’s face. It was a dangerous smile. “The chip. You can get it into their system?”

“I know a way,” Kiona said. She thought of the Re-supply Courier, following the river. A vein into the heart. “But the song… it needs to be more than groundwater. It needs to be a story. One that gets under their skin.”

Annie put down her ulu. “The old ones said the burial ridge wasn’t just where we put our dead. It was where the land remembers for us. Where the stories sink into the stone.”

Tom looked from the root, to the chip, to the faces around him. The plan was not a plan yet. It was a feeling, a direction, like following a caribou trail in fresh snow. “Then we go to the ridge,” he said. “Before their machines do. We ask the land for a story. And we give it a voice loud enough to break their world.”

Outside, a siren wailed from the Settlement, a short, sharp blast marking a shift change. The meeting was over. They left one by one, slipping back into the trees. Kiona was the last.

Tom handed her a small, wrapped package. “For your grandmother. Dried mint from the south slope.”

She took it. “The root radio… does it have a name?”

He looked at the tangled, beautiful mess of wood and wire. “I call it the Throat,” he said. “Everything needs a throat to speak.”

Kiona stepped back into the night. The Throat. She liked it. She looked at the glaring wound of the excavation, then up at the stars, sharp and clear above the spruce. The river would be quieter now, the ice settling into its nightly silence. She had a longer, darker walk home. And a new kind of listening to do.

She touched the data-chip in her pouch. It was no longer just a piece of their world. It was a seed. Now they had to plant it in the belly of the beast, and see what strange, wild fruit would grow.

 CHAPTER 2

The mint was for tea, but the smell of it, sharp and green, was for memory. Kiona’s grandmother held the dried leaves to her nose, eyes closed, and for a moment she wasn’t in the single-room cabin with its patched walls and the constant, low-grade fear. She was on the south slope in late summer, the sun warm on her back, the air humming with bees.

“He remembers,” she said, her voice a rustle. “Your uncle. He remembers the places.”

She crumbled the leaves into a pot of hot water. The scent bloomed, fighting the smell of damp wool and cold earth that always seeped in through the floorboards. The dawn light, weak and grey, did little to push back the dark in the corners. The drone had not returned. The silence felt like a held breath.

Kiona was repairing a snowshoe, replacing a broken crosspiece with a strip of steamed birch. Her hands worked on their own, a familiar rhythm of pull and tie. Her mind was on the ridge.

“You’re going to the old place,” her grandmother said. It wasn’t a question. She had a way of listening to the spaces between words.

“Tom thinks the land has a story for us. One we can use.”

“Use.” The old woman tasted the word, found it bitter. “The land’s stories are not tools. They are truths. You don’t use a truth. You carry it. Or it crushes you.”

“They’re going to dig it up, Shǫǫ.” Kiona rarely used the word for grandmother. It was for when she needed the weight of it. “They’ll take the stones, grind them for their roads. The stories will be dust in their treads.”

Her grandmother poured the tea into two chipped enamel cups. She slid one across the table to Kiona. “And you think giving the land a new kind of voice will stop them? You think they understand any language but the one of taking?”

“No,” Kiona said, honestly. “But maybe we can make their machines speak in tongues. Maybe we can confuse the taking.”

A faint, dry sound escaped her grandmother. It might have been a laugh. “Like putting a grass snake in the crawler’s fuel line. It won’t stop it, but the driver will remember the fuss.” She sipped her tea. “The ridge… it is a careful place. The stories there are not just in the stones. They are in the quiet between them. Your uncle’s wire-throat… it might hear the stones. But will it hear the quiet?”

Kiona had no answer. She finished lashing the snowshoe, tested its tension. It was good. Strong. A tool for walking softly.

“I will come with you,” her grandmother said.

Kiona looked up, startled. “It’s a long walk. The ice—”

“I have walked that ridge since before your mother was a spark in my belly. I know its ice. I know its silence. And if you are going to ask the land for a gift, you do not send a child alone. You bring an elder. For respect.”

There was no arguing. When her grandmother spoke in that tone, it was the earth itself speaking. Kiona just nodded.

They left when the light was still the colour of a bruise, following a different river trail, one that wound up into the foothills away from the Settlement’s sightlines. Her grandmother moved slowly, but with a relentless, ground-eating pace. She used no walking stick, but her hands, when they brushed a tree trunk or scooped a handful of snow to suck on, were like maps, reading the texture of bark, the granularity of the snow.

They walked in a companionable silence for hours, the only sounds their breath, the crunch of snow, and the distant, ever-present thrum of the Settlement’s generators, a sound so constant it had become part of the weather.

Near midday, they stopped by a spring that bubbled up, miraculously unfrozen, from a cleft in a rock. They ate strips of dried caribou and cold bannock. Her grandmother pointed with her chin to a scar on a nearby cliff face. “See that? Not a blast mark. That’s from the ice river, ten thousand years ago. It flowed here. It left its signature. The Settlement’s maps call this ‘Inert Geologic Feature 7-B.’” She spat into the snow. “Inert. A word for dead things.”

“Tom’s Throat heard the groundwater,” Kiona said. “It’s not inert.”

“Water moves. Water has a voice. Stone…” her grandmother trailed off, looking at the cliff. “Stone has memory. A slower memory. You need a different kind of ear.”

As they climbed higher, the trees thinned, and the wind picked up, scouring the snow into hard, sculpted waves. The Settlement was a geometric smudge in the vast, white bowl of the valley below. The excavation was a raw, yellow thumbprint. From here, Kiona could see the tiny, ant-like movement of the haulers. Systematic. Relentless.

Her grandmother stopped, her hand on Kiona’s arm. Her eyes were fixed not on the Settlement, but on the sky to the north. A line of dark clouds was massing, but that wasn’t it. A flicker of movement, too fast for a bird, too silent for a plane.

“Another tł'ih?” Kiona asked.

“No. Bigger. A… ǫǫ̀.” She used the word for a large, predatory bird. “A metal one.”

It was a surveillance craft, a sleek, winged thing that glided on some near-silent propulsion. It banked in a wide, lazy arc over the valley, then turned its nose towards the ridge. Towards them.

“Down,” Kiona hissed, pulling her grandmother behind a tumble of boulders.

They crouched in the lee of the rock. The craft’s shadow slid over the snow, a swift, dark stain. It didn’t slow. It didn’t hover. It passed directly overhead, and for a second, Kiona imagined she could feel the vibration of its cameras, a predatory attention focused on the rocks, the snow, the two heat-signatures hiding below.

Then it was gone, continuing its patrol.

“They’re watching the high places now,” her grandmother said, her voice grim. “They know the land. They are learning to look at it.”

The encounter cast a pall over the rest of the climb. The easy silence was gone, replaced by a watchful tension. Every shadow felt like a lens. Every gust of wind sounded like a rotor.

They reached the burial ridge as the short day began to fail.

It was not dramatic. Not a cliff or a pinnacle. It was a long, gentle backbone of land, dotted with clusters of lichen-crusted stones. Some were placed in circles. Some stood alone, leaning with the centuries of wind. There were no bodies, not anymore. The permafrost and the time had taken them. What remained was the intention. The memory of placement.

Her grandmother walked to the centre of the largest circle. She didn’t enter it. She stood at its edge, bowed her head, and spoke softly in the old language. Greetings. Names. An apology for the intrusion.

Kiona stood back, feeling like an eavesdropper. The wind here had a different sound. It whistled through the stone arrangements with a peculiar, melodic tone, like a flute played by a giant. The stone memory.

Her grandmother finished and gestured Kiona forward. “Now. You have your listening thing?”

Kiona unpacked a smaller version of Tom’s device from her pack. A spruce root, thinner, wired to a compact battery and a solid-state recorder Tom had salvaged and “de-branded.” It was less a radio, more a stethoscope.

“Where?” Kiona asked.

Her grandmother closed her eyes, turned her face into the wind. She pointed to a low, flat stone, half-buried in the snow at the heart of the circle. “There. That one is a heart-stone. It was placed when my grandmother’s grandmother was a girl. It holds a story of a great migration, when the caribou changed their path.”

Kiona knelt, brushed the snow away. The stone was dark, almost black, shot through with veins of quartz that glittered in the low light. She carefully wound the wire filaments around it, making contact. She switched on the recorder. The battery hummed.

At first, there was nothing. Just the hiss of the wind in the microphone.

Then, a vibration. A deep, sub-audible thrum that made the stone tremble under her fingertips. It wasn’t the pulse of water. This was slower. Heavier. A tectonic rhythm.

She turned up the gain.

The speaker emitted a low, grinding drone. It was an uncomfortable sound. It felt like pressure in the bones. Under the drone, faintly, were other textures: the skitter of a billion crystalline structures shifting infinitesimally, the sigh of continents resting on a molten heart.

“It’s… the stone’s memory?” Kiona whispered, awed and unsettled.

“Play it back,” her grandmother said.

Kiona rewound a few seconds and hit play. The grinding drone filled the air around the stone circle.

And the wind changed.

It wasn’t her imagination. The steady flute-whistle through the stones shifted pitch. It rose, harmonizing with the recorded drone, then clashing against it. The sound became a dissonant wail that seemed to come from everywhere at once.

A small stone, no bigger than a fist, perched on top of a larger one, trembled and fell into the snow with a soft thump.

Her grandmother’s face was pale. “Stop it.”

Kiona fumbled, switched the recorder off. The artificial drone died. The wind’s wail subsided, slowly returning to its normal mournful flute tone.

They stood in the sudden, ringing silence. The fallen stone was an accusation in the snow.

“It’s not a memory,” her grandmother said, her voice hushed with horror. “It is a disturbance. You are not listening to a story. You are shouting into a deep, dark well with a metal voice, and the echo… the echo moves things that should not be moved.” She looked at the wired root with disgust. “This is not a Throat. This is a shout. And you will bring the whole ridge down on our heads.”

Kiona stared at the device. She had thought they were offering the land a microphone. Instead, they had given it a feedback screech. A violent, unnatural vibration. Her grandmother was right. They were poking the stone memory with a stick.

But as she looked from the fallen stone to the distant, glowing sore of the excavation, a cold, hard thought crystallized.

What if a shout was what they needed?

Not a story to be understood. A vibration to disrupt.

“Shǫǫ,” Kiona said slowly, picking up the fallen stone and placing it gently back. It felt warm. “What if… we’re not trying to tell them a story? What if we’re trying to give the land a weapon? A shout loud enough to crack their listening posts? To make their machines tremble on their foundations?”

Her grandmother looked at her as if seeing a stranger. “You would weaponize a heartbeat? You would turn a memory into a bomb?”

“They are turning a memory into a road!” Kiona’s voice broke, surprising herself with its ferocity. “They are turning the south slope into a data-farm! They are turning your memories into ‘inert features’! If the land’s own voice, its own deep vibration, is the only thing they might feel… is that not a form of respect? To fight back with the land’s own strength?”

The old woman was silent for a long time. The wind fluted. The stone under Kiona’s wires felt alive, pregnant with a terrible power they had just tickled.

“It is a dangerous prayer,” her grandmother said finally. Her eyes were on the Settlement’s lights, winking on one by one in the twilight. “To ask the land to fight for you. You must be sure you are fighting for the land. And you must be ready for the kind of fight the land wages. It is not quick. It is not clean. It is slow, and cold, and it grinds stone to dust.” She turned and began to walk back down the ridge. “Bring your shouting stick. We will talk to your uncle. But know this, granddaughter: you have heard the stone’s voice now. And it is not a song. It is a warning.”

Kiona packed up the device, her hands trembling. The data-chip in her pouch felt heavier than ever. They had come for a story and found a seismic charge. As she followed her grandmother’s tracks down the darkening slope, the grinding drone still seemed to echo in her skull, a new and terrible rhythm. The land wasn’t just speaking.

It was growling.

 CHAPTER 3

Tom’s cabin smelled of solder and dread.

The wired root—the Throat—sat in the center of the table like a pagan altar. Kiona’s smaller recorder played the stone-drone on a loop, its low, grinding frequency making the tin cups on the shelf rattle in sympathetic vibration. Annie, Silas, Maya, and Ben listened, their faces drawn tight. Kiona’s grandmother sat by the stove, her back to the room, drinking tea and staring into the fire as if the answers were in the flames.

When the recording finished, the silence was thick.

“It’s not a broadcast,” Silas said finally, rubbing his greasy hands on his pants. “It’s a… a tremor. You can’t put that on a data-chip. It’ll corrupt everything around it. It’s noise.”

“That’s the point,” Kiona said. She felt charged, electric from the ridge. “We don’t send a message. We send a sickness. We inject their system with the land’s own indigestion.”

Tom was staring at the Throat, his big hands resting on the table. “The chip you have… it’s a logistics tag. It gets scanned at the gate, at the warehouse, at the dig site. It talks to their network. If we could make it emit this…” he gestured to the recorder, “…as a carrier wave, a background shiver…”

“It would be like a ghost in the wires,” Ben said, a flicker of understanding in his eyes. “Their sensors would get jumpy. Their comms would have static. The diggers’ guidance systems might… hiccup.”

“More than a hiccup,” Tom said. “If we can tune it right, match it to the resonant frequency of their machinery… we could make their world itch. Make the ground under their crawlers feel unstable. Make their lights flicker with a rhythm that isn’t on the grid.”

“And then they leave?” Maya asked, hope thin in her voice.

“No,” Kiona’s grandmother said from the stove, not turning around. “Then they look harder. They send more tł'ih. They bring machines that dig deeper, listen harder. A shout does not drive away a bear. It tells the bear where you are.”

“So we don’t just shout once,” Kiona said, the plan forming as she spoke, cold and clear. “We make the land itself seem… pathological. Un-cooperative. We make their technology fail when it points at the sacred places. We make the burial ridge a dead zone for their instruments. We make the south slope give their drones vertigo. We don’t fight them. We make the land fight for itself, through their own tools.”

It was a maximalist thought. Not hiding, but amplifying. Not preserving a silent truth, but weaponizing a loud, inconvenient one.

Tom’s eyes gleamed. “We’d need more than one chip. We’d need a chorus. And we’d need to tune each one to a different place—the ridge, the south slope, the river bend. A symphony of interference.”

“And how do we get these tuned chips into their bloodstream?” Annie asked, practical as ever. “We can’t just walk up to the gate.”

Kiona thought of the Re-supply Courier, the wasp-like drone. “The courier that follows the river. It lands on a pad at the logistics hub to offload. It’s not heavily guarded. It’s just a machine. If we could intercept it, just for a minute, swap out a data-pallet’s chip for one of ours…”

“That’s a five-minute window, max,” Silas said. “And you’d need to be within ten meters to hack its hatch with a manual override. That’s deep in their sensor field.”

“The river,” Kiona said. “During the spring melt, the bank under the landing pad erodes. They have a temporary sensor blind-spot there. I’ve seen it. The ice talks, and their wires get confused by the run-off.”

A slow, collective breath was drawn around the table. It was possible. It was also insane.

“We’d have one shot,” Tom said. “The first chip that goes active will alert them. The whole system will go on alert. We need all the chips to sing at once. A cacophony.”

They worked through the night. Tom and Ben de-soldered a dozen data-chips from broken equipment Silas had scavenged from the dump. Kiona and Annie worked with the Throat, using the recording from the ridge as a base frequency, then modulating it—slowing it down to a deep, gut-churning throb for the burial ridge, speeding it up to a high-pitched, nerve-jangling whine for the south slope where the mint grew, adding the watery pulse of the river to a third. Each chip was programmed with a simple, corrupting loop of sound-as-data.

By dawn, they had twelve chips. Twelve tiny shouts in plastic shells.

Kiona’s grandmother had not moved from the stove. As the others packed the chips into a waterproof case, she stood up, her joints protesting. She walked to the table and picked up one of the chips. It looked so insignificant in her wrinkled palm.

“This is your prayer,” she said to Kiona, her voice tired. “A prayer of interference. Of static. I will not bless it. But I will tell you this: the land does not know mercy. If you ask it to fight, it will not distinguish between their machines and your feet. The tremor you start will not stay where you put it. You are waking something up. Be ready for what answers.”

She placed the chip back on the table and left, slipping out into the grey pre-dawn without a sound.

Her words hung in the close air. A final, cold truth.

Tom broke the silence. “The main melt starts in three days. The forecast calls for a warm wind. That’s our window.”

The plan was set. They dispersed into the creeping light, each with a task. Silas and Ben would plant chips near key infrastructure using their knowledge of the maintenance tunnels. Maya would watch the patrol patterns. Annie would be ready at the cabin with a fallback location.

Kiona and Tom would handle the courier.

For the next two days, Kiona moved through a world of heightened sensation. Every sound from the Settlement was a potential alarm. Every drone in the sky was a sentry. She checked the river ice a dozen times a day, listening to its conversation turn from sly chuckle to wet, rushing roar. The thaw was coming early, accelerated by the Settlement’s heat-island. Even the weather was being bent.

The night before the melt, she couldn’t sleep. She lay on her bunk, listening to her grandmother’s steady breathing from across the room. The old woman had not spoken of the plan again. Her silence was a wall.

Just before dawn, Kiona heard it. A new sound, weaving with the river’s voice. A deep, rhythmic chug-chug-chug that vibrated through the ground. She went to the window.

In the valley, under the flat glare of the arc-lights, a new machine had arrived. It was colossal. A walking excavator, with four hydraulic legs like a giant insect, and a boom-arm that could reach five stories high. It was being assembled on the edge of the yellow gash, its silhouette a jagged blasphemy against the starry sky. Its purpose was clear: to clear the spruce grove. To take the trees in great, greedy handfuls.

Their window had just shrunk.

She dressed quickly in the dark, her hands steady. She packed the case with the chips. She checked her tools: the manual override probe, the insulated cutters, the bone-handled knife. When she turned, her grandmother was sitting up on her cot, watching her.

“The big machine is here,” Kiona said.

“I heard its heart,” her grandmother replied. “It is a hungry heart.”

Kiona knelt by her cot. “I have to go.”

The old woman reached out, her hand cool and dry on Kiona’s cheek. It was a gesture from childhood. “You carry our voice into the metal world. Do not forget which voice is yours.” She pressed something into Kiona’s hand. A small, woven bag of muskox wool. “Tobacco. For the river. When you ask a spirit to help you, you must give it something first.”

Kiona clutched the bag, a lump in her throat. She nodded, unable to speak, and slipped out the door.

The world outside was a monochrome of dark blue and black. She met Tom at the edge of the spruce grove. He had seen the walking excavator too. His face was grim.

“Change of plan,” he whispered. “We do it tonight. Now. Before that thing is operational. The melt has started early. The river’s loud. It will cover us.”

They moved like ghosts through the fringe, using the machinery’s own noise as cover. The chug-chug-chug of the walking excavator’s generators was a perfect drumbeat for their infiltration. They reached the eroded bank below the logistics landing pad. The soil was wet and unstable, the river gnawing at it hungrily. Just as Kiona had predicted, the sensor post on the bank listed at a crazy angle, its light dark.

Above them, on

 CHAPTER 4

The landing pad was a scar of poured light above them, a chemical yellow that did not belong to the night. It bleached the snow beneath it into a dead, flat sheet. From their pocket of shadow under the bank, Kiona and Tom watched the silhouettes of two security techs move across that brightness, their breath pluming in the false day. The chug-chug-chug of the walking excavator’s generators was a constant, gut-deep tremor through the ground, a rhythm that made Kiona’s teeth ache.

Tom pointed a gloved finger, tracing a path along the eroded bank. The river had done half their work. The sensor post leaned drunkenly, its housing cracked open like an egg, wires spilling into the mud. The collapse had taken a bite out of the bank directly beneath the pad’s western support pylon. The pylon itself, a thick trunk of composite and steel, was exposed down to its foundations, which were not foundations at all, but anchors drilled into permafrost that was no longer permanent. The river was talking to it, too. A low, slushing sound of dissolution.

“There,” Tom mouthed.

The plan was a fragile thing, spun from desperation and the river’s own hunger. Infiltrate the pad’s underbelly through the erosion gap. Access the main data conduit junction where it ran down the compromised pylon. Upload the chips—the recorded river songs, the ground-penetrating radar maps of the ancient fish runs, the elders’ testimonies that were not testimonies but stories, the kind that got under the skin of law. A data-poem. A ghost in the machine. It was their last, best voice.

Kiona checked the case at her hip, felt the solid click of the latches. Her grandmother’s tobacco pouch was a warm lump against her chest. She thought of the hungry heart of the machine, and her own heart beat a frantic counter-rhythm against it.

One of the techs on the pad lit a cigarette, the flare of the match a tiny, human punctuation in the industrial glare. The other laughed, a sound swallowed by the generator’s drone. They walked toward the far side, drawn by the spectacle of the assembling excavator.

“Go,” Tom said.

They went up the bank like otters, low and fluid, using the frozen clods and exposed roots for purchase. The mud was a cold, sucking grip at their boots. They reached the shadow of the pylon, a world of stark black and dripping ice. The junction box was there, a sealed grey cube mounted at chest-height, lit by a single, faltering status LED. Kiona unslung her pack, her fingers already pulling out the manual override probe. Tom kept watch, his body a tense column against the blue dark.

The probe slid into the maintenance port. She felt the internal locks resist, then yield with a soft, metallic sigh. The casing unsealed. Inside, a nest of fiber-optic threads glowed with faint, racing colors—data like blood in capillaries. The central processor block was cool to the touch. This was the artery. This was where they had to speak.

She opened the case. The chips were slivers of obsidian, inert and heavy. She slotted the first one home. A progress bar, invisible to her, would be filling on some server a thousand miles away. A ghost entering the house.

A new sound cut through the generator’s beat. Not the river. A harmonic, rising whine. Then a heavy, rhythmic crunch-crunch-crunch.

Tom’s hand clamped on her shoulder. He didn’t need to point.

Up on the pad, backlit by the lights, the walking excavator took its first step.

It was a motion that defied sense. The great insectile leg, twice as thick as a spruce trunk, pistoned upward, hinged, and then plunged downward, the pointed foot sinking deep into the gravel and frozen earth. The entire machine listed, then stabilized. The boom-arm, a skeletal giant’s finger, swung lazily in a test arc. The crunch was the sound of the world being broken deliberately.

Kiona’s breath caught. The plan, the fragile plan, had assumed the machine was still asleep. It was not. It was stretching.

“Faster,” Tom whispered, his voice stripped thin.

She slotted the second chip. The river’s thaw song, digitized, a whisper of ancient water into a stream of ones and zeroes. The third chip. The fish runs, the memory of silver bodies in the dark.

Crunch-crunch-crunch.
Another step. It was turning. Its floodlights, cold and surgical, swept across the far tree line, turning the spruce into stark, black cutouts.

Kiona’s fingers fumbled the fourth chip. It clattered against the casing. She snatched it from the air, pushed it home. The stories. The voice.

A different light hit them. Not the excavator’s. A white, searching beam from the eastern edge of the pad. A handheld spotlight.

“Hey!” A voice, human and sharp, cut through the mechanical noise. “Activity at Pylon Seven! Under the platform!”

The plan tore like rotten cloth.

Tom shoved her. “Go! Down to the river!”

“The upload’s not—”

“Go!”

He turned, not down the bank, but up, pulling himself onto the lip of the pad, drawing his body into a crouch. A diversion. A stupid, brave diversion.

Kiona slammed the junction box closed, the case in her hand, and half-slid, half-fell down the unstable bank. Mud and ice scraped against her parka. She hit the bottom and ran, not away, but along the bank toward the thicker darkness of the spruce grove. The spotlight beam jabbed down, searching, finding Tom.

“Stop right there! Hands where I can see them!”

She glanced back. Tom stood on the edge of the light, his hands raised slowly. He was looking not at the security guard, but past him, at the excavator. His mouth was open in a shape that was not fear, but awe.

Kiona followed his gaze.

The walking excavator, having turned, was now facing the grove. Its floodlights pinned the trees in a cage of light. The boom-arm lowered, not with the jerky motion of a machine, but with a terrible, predatory grace. At its end, the shears—massive, serrated blades meant for delimbing whole trees—opened like the maw of a metal lamprey.

It took another step toward the grove. The ground transmitted the impact up through Kiona’s bones.

This was not just clearance. This was a statement. A demonstration. The hungry heart was beating, and it was coming to eat.

She plunged into the trees. The world shut out the direct light, became a maze of blue-black trunks and the panicked scatter of her own breath. The case was a clumsy weight. She had to get it to the fallback, the old trapper’s cabin upriver. She had to finish the upload. It was the only voice they had left.

But the river was talking louder now, a rushing, gleeful sound. The first real melt was beginning. And between her and the cabin was the crossing. The sly, porous ice. The most dangerous time.

She ran, the sounds of shouting and the relentless crunch-crunch-crunch of the machine fading behind her, replaced by the wet, growing chuckle of the water. She was carrying a ghost in a case, and a pouch of tobacco for a spirit, and the two weights felt exactly the same.

The spruce grove was a cathedral she had known since childhood, but now it felt like a tomb waiting to be desecrated. The light from the excavator bled through the branches, creating long, moving shadows that tricked the eye. Every familiar stump, every twist in the game trail, became a potential ambush. She moved by feel more than sight, the memory in her muscles more reliable than her racing mind.

The river’s voice grew from a chuckle to a low, steady roar. It was the sound of weight shifting, of a billion crystalline bonds breaking. She reached the bank at the old crossing point. The ice looked the same—a white highway under the starlight. But the sound was all wrong. It was a wet, grumbling exhalation.

From back toward the pad, a new sound joined the symphony: the shriek of rending wood. A sharp, singular crack, like a giant’s bone breaking, followed by a vast, sighing crash. Then the excavator’s engine revved, a sound of pure satisfaction. They were taking the first trees. The grove was bleeding.

Kiona’s throat tightened. She forced her eyes away from the distant, hellish glow and onto the ice. Tom’s words echoed. The river will cover us. It would cover her, too, if she misstepped. She unzipped her parka, fumbled for the muskox wool pouch. Her fingers were stiff. She pinched a generous offering of the dark, fragrant tobacco and knelt at the very edge of the bank.

“Old Mother,” she whispered, the words stolen by the roar. “I carry a ghost that needs to speak. Lend me your solid back.”

She sprinkled the tobacco onto the dark, open water at the bank’s edge. It swirled and vanished. No sign, no acknowledgment. The spirit was either busy, or indifferent, or waiting.

There was no more time. She stood, adjusted the strap of the case across her body, and stepped onto the ice.

It did not crack. It groaned. A deep, resonant complaint that traveled up her legs. She knew this language. This was the ice saying it was tired. She began the crossing, not in a straight line, but in the old, zig-zag path that followed the strongest flows. Each step was a negotiation. A testing of the surface with her weight before committing. The roar was all around her now, coming up through the ice as much as through the air. She was walking on the roof of a shouting cavern.

Halfway across, the ice changed. It became darker, translucent where the snow had blown away. She could see the movement beneath, the black water streaked with pale, suspended platelets of ice. It was like looking at the sky through a night storm.

A sound behind her. Not the river. A drone.

She froze, mid-step. The familiar, waspish whine. She turned her head slowly.

It was there, hovering at the tree line behind her, a black cutout against the lesser dark. Its single, red eye was lit. It had found her. It was watching her cross.

The knowledge was a cold spike in her gut. They knew. They knew she had the data. They would track her to the cabin. They would take the ghost before it could speak.

The ice groaned again, a longer, more plaintive sound. The drone advanced, gliding out over the bank, maintaining its distance but keeping her locked in its eye.

A new calculation, cold and sharp, cut through her fear. The cabin was compromised. The fallback was a trap. She had to change the destination. There was only one place left where a ghost might hide, where the metal world’s eyes might not follow.

She looked downriver, toward the deep canyon where the river narrowed and plunged between cliffs of basalt. The Raven’s Throat. The ice there would be thin, non-existent in the rapids. But the cliffs… there were old ways. Places to climb. Places to hide.

The decision was a physical shift inside her. She stopped her careful zig-zag. She turned directly downriver, toward the growing thunder, and began to run.

The ice protested violently. A spiderweb of cracks shot out from her boots, white lines on the dark surface. The drone’s whine pitched higher, accelerating to follow.

She ran not away from the roar, but into it. The smooth ice gave way to broken pressure ridges, heaves of ice that had buckled like pottery. She scrambled over them, the case banging against her ribs. The drone was closer now, its shadow flitting over the jagged landscape around her.

Ahead, the world ended. The flat river ice terminated in a jagged line of black. Beyond was the roar, unleashed. The canyon.

She reached the edge. Below, the river was a chaos of churning black water and car-sized ice chunks being tossed like gravel. The mist rose cold and stinging. The opposite cliff was a sheer, dark wall, slick with spray.

The drone hovered ten feet behind her, at the very edge of the stable ice. Its red eye watched, unblinking. Recording the fugitive at the precipice.

Kiona looked at it. She saw her own face, reflected a thousand times in some distant server. A ghost carried by a ghost.

She backed up two steps, took a breath that was half mist, and ran straight for the edge.

She did not jump into the water. At the last possible moment, she dropped to her knees, sliding on the wet ice, and grabbed for the one thing she had remembered—a rusted, ancient piton driven into the cliff face just below the rim, a relic from some long-ago climber. Her gloves scraped over wet rock, caught. Her body slammed against the cliff, her legs dangling over the furious void.

Above, the drone shot forward, peering over the edge. Its red eye gazed down at her, a silent question.

Kiona let go with one hand, swung wildly, and grabbed a narrow, icy ledge with her fingertips. She began to move sideways, crab-like, away from the piton, away from the drone’s direct view, into the thick curtain of mist. The world shrank to the inch of rock under her fingers, the scream of water below, and the fading, frustrated whine of the machine above.

She had asked the river for its solid back. It had given her a wet, crumbling wall instead. It was help of a kind. She clung there, in the thunder and the mist, the case heavy on her back. The ghost was still with her. But so were the eyes. And the hungry heart was still beating, back in the grove, eating the world one tree at a time. Her window, she knew, was now just a crack of light, and it was closing fast.

 Chapter 5

 CHAPTER 5

The mist was a blindfold. The river was a shout in her ears, a constant, battering argument against life. Kiona’s world was the cold grain of the rock under her fingertips, the burn in her shoulders, the ledge no wider than two fingers that she inched along, sideways, into the white roar.

The drone’s whine had faded, swallowed by the canyon’s throat. But she felt its red eye like a brand between her shoulder blades. A ghost’s gaze was weightless, but it could pin you to a rock as sure as any iron spike. She kept moving. The case on her back was a dead weight, threatening to peel her off the wall and toss her into the churn below. It contained her grandmother’s trembling hands, the old woman’s whisper of tł'ih. It contained the grove, and the thing that ate it. It was the reason she was here, clinging to rotten stone.

Her gloves were soaked, their grip turning to slick rubber. She tested each hold, digging her toes into seams of ice that wept cold water. The mist coated everything in a skin of impossible slime. Once, a chunk of ice the size of a shed broke from the canyon wall upstream and plunged into the black water. The impact was a deep, wet thunder that shook the rock beneath her hands. She pressed her face against the stone, waiting for the spray of the wave to hit. It came, a slap of freezing water that stole her breath and left her coughing, her hands scrambling for purchase on nothing.

She found a crack, jammed her fingers in. Held.

This was the river’s answer. Not a solid back to cross, but a wet, vertical grave to skirt. It was a lesson. Help, when it came, was never what you asked for. It was what you could survive.

The ledge began to taper. She felt it with her toe—a dwindling, then nothing. Her heart, already a frantic bird against her ribs, seemed to freeze. She stretched, patting the wet rock face. Nothing. The ledge simply ended. To her left, the mist swirled, opaque. To her right, back the way she’d come, was the drone and the open edge where the ice met the drop. Straight down was the river’s maw.

Panic was a luxury. It was a warm, full-body feeling, and she had no room for it. Cold calculus took its place. She could not go back. She could not stay.

She looked up. The cliff face bulged outward above her, slick and featureless. But six feet to her left, through the gauze of mist, she saw a darker patch. A shadow. An indentation. It could be a shallow scoop, a tomb for a bird. It could be a deeper cut. A way.

There was no decision to make. Only a sequence of actions. She would have to traverse the blank section. She would have to trust the friction of her body on wet stone, for three, maybe four moves, with nothing beneath her but the roar.

Kiona exhaled, a plume of white in the wet air. She unclipped the case from her back. The sudden lightness was a shock, a temptation to float away. She looped the strap around her wrist, twice, pulling it tight until the leather bit. The case would dangle below her, a pendulum that would try to swing her into the void. It was better than its dead weight on her shoulders.

She pressed her palms flat against the cold rock. She leaned out, away from the dwindling ledge, transferring her weight onto the friction of her body. Her boots scraped, seeking purchase. She found a dimple, a bump no larger than a coin. She committed.

The first move was a shuddering slide. The case swung, banging against the cliff, pulling at her arm. She gasped, her fingers clawing at nothing. Her right foot held. She brought her left foot across, found another smear of grip. Her mind emptied of everything but the map of the rock—this rough patch, that seam of quartz.

The second move. Her right hand reached, blind, into the mist. Her fingers brushed stone, slid off. She stretched further, tendons screaming. Her fingertips dug into a vertical crack. She pulled, her body a lever against the wall. The case swung wider, a deadly arc. She felt her balance go, felt the suck of the drop beneath her.

The third move was not a move at all. It was a fall, arrested. She pushed off with her left foot, lunging for the shadow. Her right hand lost its hold. For a heartbeat, she was airborne, attached to the cliff only by her left hand jammed in the crack. Then her body slammed into the rock, the impact driving the air from her lungs. But her chest was against stone. Her feet scrabbled, found a lip. She was in the shadow.

It was not a scoop. It was a crack, a vertical slit in the cliff face, deep enough to take her body if she turned sideways. A chimney. She shoved herself into it, back against one wall, boots braced against the other. She shook, a full-body tremble that came from the marrow out. The case hung from her wrist, tapping rhythmically against the rock. She let her head fall back, gulping the mist-thick air. She had not fallen. The ghost had not seen her fall.

But the crack went up, into the gloom. And it went down, into the thunder. She was not safe. She was trapped in a stone throat.

The climb up the chimney was a slow, grinding birth. She used knees and elbows and the raw strength of her back, inching upward in the dark, damp cleft. The river’s roar became muted, filtered through stone. The world narrowed to the pressure on her spine, the scrape of granite on her parka, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of the case against the wall. Time unspooled in the dark. She thought of her grandmother, alone in the cabin with the silence after the drone. She thought of the grove, the clean, precise bite of the feller-buncher’s saw, the toppling of the ancient spruce that had stood since before her great-grandmother’s time. She thought of the data in the case, the maps and soil assays and acoustic surveys that proved the grove was a single, vast, connected being. Proof. It felt like ashes in her mouth.

The light changed. The grey gloom of the crack began to soften, to warm. She craned her neck. Above, she could see a slice of sky—not the flat white of cloud, but the clear, hard blue of afternoon. She pushed harder, her muscles burning with a clean, simple fire. The top.

She hauled herself over a final lip, out of the stone throat and onto a flat, mossy bench. She lay on her back, heaving, the sky a brilliant, uncaring blue above her. The roar of the river was a distant complaint now. She was on a broad ledge, maybe thirty feet across, that curved along the canyon wall. Behind her, the cliff continued upward, formidable but climbable. Ahead, the ledge wound around a bend, out of sight.

She sat up, wincing at the protest in every joint. She pulled the case into her lap, checking its seals. It was scuffed, damp, but intact. Her proof. Her burden.

A sound made her freeze. Not the river. Not the wind.

It was a low, rhythmic hum. A mechanical purr.

It came from around the bend.

Kiona crept forward, keeping low, her boots silent on the thick moss. The ledge widened. As she rounded the curve, she stopped, her breath catching.

The ledge opened into a large, sheltered amphitheater, a natural bowl in the cliff face. And in its center, gleaming under the sun like a strange, metallic egg, was a drone. But not like the black wasp that had haunted her window. This one was larger, the size of a small canoe. Its shell was a matte grey, and it rested on six articulated legs, folded beneath it. It was dormant, powered down. A charging station, sleek and solar-paneled, was nestled against the cliff wall, a single cord snaking to the drone’s underbelly. This was no simple observer. This was a carrier. A hunter.

And it was not alone.

Slumped against the rock wall, near the charging station, was a figure in a grey environmental suit. The suit’s visor was retracted. The face inside was young, pale, and slicked with sweat. The eyes were closed. One gloved hand was pressed to the side of the suit, where a dark, wet stain was spreading. A jagged tear in the material, as if from a fall onto sharp rock.

Kiona’s instincts screamed at her to melt back into the crack, to climb, to run. This was the enemy. The sender of ghosts. The hand that held the saw.

But the figure was hurt. And alone. And so terribly young.

She watched for a full minute. The chest rose and fell in shallow, quick breaths. The stain on the suit grew no larger, but it was already significant. The drone sat, a silent guardian, a sleeping metal hound.

Kiona stepped out of the shadows.

The figure’s eyes flew open. They were a startling, electric blue, wide with pain and shock. A hand fumbled at a utility belt.

“Don’t,” Kiona said, her voice rough from disuse and mist. She held her own hands out, empty. “You’re bleeding.”

The figure—a woman, Kiona saw now—stared, her breath hitching. Up close, she looked even younger, maybe twenty. Her hair, plastered to her forehead, was blonde and fine. “You,” she whispered. “The fugitive. Asset K-7.”

“My name is Kiona.”

The woman blinked, as if the name was a foreign object. Her hand still hovered over her belt. “You’re supposed to be… the data said you’d likely attempt the ice bridge. That you’d fall. Probability was eighty-seven percent.”

“The data was wrong,” Kiona said flatly. She nodded at the suit. “What happened?”

“Rappel line snapped. Fell twenty feet onto this ledge. The rock…” She gestured weakly at her side. “Suit’s med-system is trying to clot it. Not… not working great.”

Kiona moved closer, slowly, as if approaching a spooked animal. She could see the tear now, a nasty gash in the complex material. A slow, steady seep of blood welled from it, being absorbed by the suit’s inner layer, which was already saturated. “You need a real patch. Pressure.”

“In the kit. On the belt. Can’t… my hands are shaking.”

Kiona knelt. She could smell the clean, sterile scent of the suit, undercut by the copper tang of blood. She found the medical kit, a flat, hard case. She opened it. Inside were unfamiliar packets, tubes of sealant, a roll of something that looked like smart-bandage. It was technology from another planet.

“The blue tube,” the woman breathed, her head lolling back against the rock. “Synth-skin catalyst. Then the grey bandage.”

Kiona worked quickly, her own hands steady. She squeezed the blue gel into the wound—the woman hissed—then pressed the grey bandage over it. The material instantly contracted, molding itself to the tear, applying firm, even pressure. The seepage slowed, then stopped.

“Thanks,” the woman muttered, her eyes closing again. “I’m Lyn.”

“Why are you here, Lyn?” Kiona asked, sitting back on her heels. “Not on this ledge. Here. In this place.”

Lyn’s eyes opened. The blue was clouded with pain, but sharp. “To retrieve you. And the data. The grove project is… it’s critical path. The cellulose structure, the mycorrhizal network… it’s a blueprint. For stabilization. For the new substrates.”

“The grove is a living thing,” Kiona said, the words tasting of iron. “It’s not a blueprint. It’s a home.”

“A home for what?” Lyn’s voice gained a sliver of strength, a thread of conviction. “For moss and caribou and… and you? It’s inefficient. It’s chaotic. We can extract the pattern, the perfect, efficient pattern it represents, and replicate it at scale. In the arcologies. We can build forests that don’t burn, that don’t sicken, that produce exactly what’s needed. We can fix the world.”

Kiona listened to the words. They were clean, logical. They were the words of the hungry heart, beating in its distant chamber. They saw a forest and saw only a problem to be solved, a resource to be parsed. They saw her grandmother and saw an inefficiency. They saw her and saw Asset K-7.

“You’re bleeding out for a pattern,” Kiona said softly.

“I’m securing a future,” Lyn countered, but her voice wavered. She looked past Kiona, at the dormant drone. “The Warden will wake when its solar cycle completes. In about an hour. It will scan me, see I’m injured. It will scan you, confirm your identity. It will sedate you with a focused emitter, load us both into its cargo bay, and fly us back to the forward base. That’s the protocol. That’s the plan.”

“That’s your ghost’s plan,” Kiona said.

“It’s the only plan.” Lyn’s gaze met hers. There was no malice in it, only a profound, trained certainty. It was worse than hatred. “You can’t climb the rest of the way. Not with that.” She nodded at the case. “And I can’t walk. So we wait for the Warden. It’s optimal.”

Kiona looked at the drone. The Warden. Its smooth shell held no red eye. It did not need to watch. It knew. It calculated. It would wake, and it would enact its protocol. It would carry their two bodies back, one as salvage, one as asset. The data would be ingested. The pattern would be extracted. The last grove would fall, and from its bones would rise a perfect, silent, efficient imitation.

This was the life-and-death crisis. Not the river, not the cliff. This. This calm, bleeding girl and her sleeping metal guardian. This was the defeat. It was neat, and logical, and inescapable.

A deep, cold stillness settled over Kiona. The frantic bird in her chest went quiet. She had fought the river, the rock, the ice. She could not fight this clean, bloodless logic. It was a wall smoother than any cliff.

She sat down on the moss, a few feet from Lyn, her back against the warm stone. She placed the case beside her. She watched the sky. The sun was beginning its descent, painting the high clouds with streaks of apricot and rose.

“Tell me,” Kiona said, her voice barely audible over the distant river, “about the substrates.”

Lyn talked. At first, it was technical—polymer matrices, photosynthetic yields, neural-net pruning algorithms modeled on root communication. But as the light deepened, and the pain in her side was held at bay by the suit’s drugs, her words softened. She talked of the grey cities she came from, where the air was filtered and the only green was behind polymer glass. She talked of the Project, the great, gleaming hope of it. To build a world that didn’t hurt, that didn’t decay, that was safe. She spoke of her mentors, who called the natural world “the legacy chaos.” She believed she was on a rescue mission. Saving a pattern from the dying woods. Saving a woman from a crumbling ledge.

Kiona listened. She heard the hunger in it, not for wood or land, but for order. A terrible, consuming need for a world that made sense. A world without wet chuckles under ice, without unpredictable thaws, without grandmothers who saw ghosts in machines. A world that could be held in a server, clean and still.

As Lyn spoke, Kiona felt something within her break. Not a bone, but a hope. The hope that they could be reasoned with. The hope that the value of the grove, of her grandmother’s stories, of the river’s old songs, could be translated into a language they would understand. It was a hope that had driven her to collect the data, to run. It died now, quietly, on that sun-warmed ledge. It was a symbolic death, colder than the river mist. The old Kiona, the one who believed proof could be a shield, bled out on the moss beside Lyn’s physical stain.

The sun dipped lower. A shadow crept across the ledge, touching the Warden’s feet. A soft, internal chime sounded from the drone. A status light on its carapace began to pulse a gentle, sleepy yellow.

Lyn fell silent. She looked at the drone, then at Kiona. “It’s starting its wake cycle.”

Kiona nodded. She felt empty. Cleansed. The case of data beside her was now just a box of dead things. The proof was worthless. The only thing that mattered was the thing they could not capture, could not parse: her will. What she chose to do in this final, closing window.

She stood up. Her body ached, but the stillness was gone, replaced by a fatal clarity.

“What are you doing?” Lyn asked, a note of anxiety piercing her fatigue.

Kiona walked to the edge of the ledge, looking down at the canyon where she had almost died. The river was a silver thread in the deepening gloom. She then walked to the charging station. She studied the cord that snaked into the Warden’s belly.

“You can’t,” Lyn said, understanding dawning. “It’s hardened. It has back-up cells. Disabling it requires codes I don’t have.”

Kiona wasn’t looking at the cord. She was looking at the rock face behind the charging station. At a fissure, dark and narrow, that ran vertically up the cliff. It was not a chimney. It was a crack. But at its base was a pile of scree—loose rock, from a long-ago fall.

The Warden hummed louder. Its legs twitched, beginning to unfold.

Kiona bent down. She picked up a rock the size of her fist. It was heavy, granular.

“Asset K-7, stand down,” Lyn’s voice came, trying for command, fraying at the edges. “The emitter will target you if you show hostility!”

Kiona ignored her. She hefted the rock. She did not throw it at the Warden. She turned and threw it, with all the strength left in her battered body, at the pile of scree beneath the fissure.

The rock struck with a loud crack. It was not enough to trigger a slide. But it was a signal.

The Warden was fully awake now. It rose on its six legs, its sensor array—a smooth, glassy dome—glowing to life. It swiveled towards her. A low-pitched whine emanated from it, the sound of focusing energy. The sedative emitter.

Kiona picked up another rock. And another. She threw them, not at the machine, but at the base of the cliff, at the weak point. Crack. Crack.

“What are you doing?” Lyn screamed.

The Warden took a step forward, its movement eerily fluid. The whine peaked.

Kiona threw a last, larger stone. It hit a key wedge of rock.

With a deep, grinding groan, the pile of scree shifted. Then, with a roar that dwarfed the river’s distant noise, the fissure gave way. A section of the cliff face, ten feet tall and tons heavy, sheared away from the wall and collapsed directly onto the charging station—and onto the Warden.

It was not a clean smash. It was a slow, crushing avalanche of stone and dust. The charging station vanished in an instant. The Warden was faster. It tried to leap back, but two of its legs were caught, pinned, then shattered under the falling rock. The main body was struck a glancing, massive blow. It was flung sideways, carapace cracking like an eggshell, internal components sparking. It crashed onto its side, legs twitching spasmodically, its sensor dome dark. The whine cut off, replaced by the hiss of escaping fluids and the settling rumble of rock.

Dust billowed across the ledge. Kiona stood amidst it, coughing, her ears ringing.

When the dust cleared, the scene was transformed. The sheltered amphitheater was gone. A raw, jagged scar marked the cliff. The Warden was a broken toy half-buried in rubble, its one visible leg giving a final, pathetic jerk before going still. The charging station was obliterated.

Silence rushed in, broken only by the eternal river and Lyn’s ragged sobs.

Kiona walked over to the girl. Lyn was staring at the wreckage, her face white with shock, her blue eyes wide with a horror deeper than pain. She was not looking at a machine. She was looking at the shattered spine of her world, her logic, her future.

“You killed it,” she whispered, her voice hollow. “You killed the Warden.”

“No,” Kiona said, brushing stone dust from her hands. “I asked the cliff for help. It gave me a landslide.” She knelt, opening the medical kit again. She found a syringe of painkiller, administered it to Lyn’s suit port. “The protocol is gone, Lyn. The optimal path is buried.”

Lyn just stared, uncomprehending.

Kiona went to her case. She opened it. She took out the data drive, a slim, black rectangle. She held it for a moment, feeling its weight. Then she walked to the edge of the ledge and dropped it. It fell, a tiny black sliver, disappearing into the gorge and the roaring water below. The proof was gone. The pattern was drowned.

She returned to the case. From beneath the empty folders, she pulled out the real cargo. A smaller, oilskin-wrapped bundle. Her grandmother’s medicine pouch. Dried meat. A coil of sinew. A firestarter. The real things.

She shouldered the case again, lighter now. She walked to Lyn and held out a hand.

“The climb out is there,” Kiona said, pointing to the route she had seen earlier. “It’s hard. You’re hurt. I’m tired. But we can do it. Or you can stay here, and wait for the next ghost they send. It will find you with a broken drone at your feet. They will have questions. Their questions are not kind.”

Lyn looked from Kiona’s hand to the wreckage, to the darkening sky. The certainty in her eyes had been crushed as thoroughly as the Warden. All that was left was pain, and fear, and a vast, empty confusion.

Slowly, trembling, she reached up and took Kiona’s hand.

It was not a rescue. It was not a surrender. It was a simple, physical fact. One body, pulling another body up from the rock. There was no protocol for it. It was inefficient. It was chaotic.

It was the only thing left.

As Kiona braced herself, helping Lyn to her feet, she looked east. The first star of evening pricked the violet sky. Her window was now a jagged, dusty hole in a cliff face. But it was open. And ahead, in the gathering dark, the land stretched away, silent and vast. The hungry heart was still beating. But here, on this broken ledge, she had just fed it a stone.

 CHAPTER 6

The climb was a slow, shared bleeding of warmth. Kiona’s muscles burned with a clean, animal fire. Lyn’s breath was a ragged sawing in the dark, punctuated by hitched gasps of pain the drugs couldn’t fully mute. They moved as a single, four-legged creature, Kiona bearing the weight, Lyn offering the desperate, clumsy purchase of her good leg. The rock was cold and granular under their hands, tasting of ancient dust and this morning’s frost. There was no talk. The only language was the scuff of a boot, the grunt of effort, the silent transfer of force from one body to another against the pull of the earth.

They reached the top as the last of the light bled out behind the mountains, leaving a bruise of indigo in the west. It was not a true summit, just a broad, rocky shelf that shrugged away from the gorge. They collapsed, not in a heap, but in parallel, two lengths of exhausted matter on the stone. The wind here had a different voice. It wasn’t the gorge’s roar. It was a wider, lonelier sigh, moving through the stunted pines and over the lichen-crusted rock. It carried the smell of snow from the high peaks.

Kiona lay on her back, the case a hard ridge against her spine. The sky was a vast, star-pricked bowl. Her grandmother’s sky. The tł'ih sky, too, probably, but for now, the drones were blind. The Warden was a shattered tooth in the river’s throat. The data drive was water and silt. For this one breath, this one point of stillness at the top of a climb, the wires were cut.

She sat up. Lyn hadn’t moved. Her face was a pale smudge, her eyes open, fixed on the constellations.

“Your leg,” Kiona said. Her voice was rough, unused.

“It’s here,” Lyn said, the words flat. “I’m here. The parameters are… absent.”

Kiona rummaged in the case, past the oilskin bundle. Her fingers found the medical kit. She had more painkillers, a foam-setting cast, antiseptic wipes in little silver packets that felt like stolen technology. She moved to Lyn’s side. In the starlight, she cut away the suit material from the leg. The break was ugly, a sharp, wrong angle just above the ankle. Kiona worked without speaking, cleaning, aligning, spraying the foam that hissed and hardened into a rigid white shell. Lyn didn’t flinch. She just watched Kiona’s hands as if they were performing a distant, mildly interesting ritual.

“You dropped the proof,” Lyn said, finally, as Kiona secured the cast.

“I did.”

“It was the primary objective.”

“It was their primary objective,” Kiona said, taping the last edge. “Mine was to get across the river.”

Lyn was silent for a long time. The wind sighed. “The simulation did not account for this. A nullification of the mission asset by the courier. It was an irrational variable.”

“I’m full of those.” Kiona sat back on her heels. She pulled the oilskin bundle onto her lap. The familiar, lumpy weight of it was a knot of reality in the cool dark. She untied the sinew cord. Inside was her grandmother’s pouch, made of smoked moosehide, soft as a whisper. The dried caribou meat, strips hard as wood. The firestarter: a chunk of quartz, a curl of birch fungus, a worn steel striker. The real things.

She built a small fire in the lee of a boulder, a tiny, defiant eye of light in the vast dark. The tinder caught with a crisp snap, and the flame licked at the dry pine twigs she’d gathered, their resin popping. The smell was immediate and profound: warmth, memory, a fixed point in a shifting world.

She handed a strip of meat to Lyn. Lyn took it, turning it over in her fingers.

“This is inefficient biomass,” she said.

“It’s food. It doesn’t report your location when you digest it.”

Lyn looked at her then, really looked, for the first time since the ledge. The firelight danced in her eyes, replacing the blank screen with something flickering and alive. She brought the meat to her mouth, bit off a piece, chewed slowly. Her face did the complicated, human work of processing toughness, salt, a faint smoky sweetness.

“It is… dense,” Lyn conceded.

A laugh punched out of Kiona, short and surprised. It echoed off the boulder and was swallowed by the wind. “Yeah.”

They ate. The silence between them changed. It was no longer the silence of shock or sheer exertion. It was the quiet of two people at a very small fire, at the edge of a very large night. The hungry heart of the land beat beneath them, but here, for a moment, they were not food. They were witnesses.

“My grandmother,” Kiona said, staring into the flames, “she calls drones tł'ih. Ghosts. She says they see without eyes, carry faces to people you’ll never meet.”

Lyn stopped chewing. She gazed at the fire, and Kiona saw her replaying a thousand silent flights, a million captured data points—a woman hauling water, a child chasing a dog, a man fixing a net, all reduced to pixels and patterns, fed into the hungry, invisible stomach of something in a city far away.

“We called it remote situational awareness,” Lyn said, her voice barely above the crackle of the fire. “Optimization of resource flow. Threat assessment.”

“What do you call it now?”

Lyn didn’t answer. She just watched the flames eat the wood.

“The Warden,” Lyn said, after a long time. “Its core directive was preservation of the data stream. Continuity of observation. When you threatened the stream, its threat-assessment matrix flagged you as a terminal anomaly. It was going to kill you to preserve the data. That was… optimal.”

“I know.”

“I approved that protocol,” Lyn said. The words fell into the fire like stones. “I helped write it. A terminal anomaly must be removed to protect the integrity of the whole. It was clean. Logical.”

The wind picked up, making the fire flinch. Kiona fed it another twig.

“And on the ledge?” Kiona asked. “When it came for you? Was that optimal?”

Lyn’s hand went to her ribs, where the suit was torn and stained. “I became part of the anomaly. The calculation changed.” She looked at her hands, then at Kiona, her face a mask of confused pain. “But you… you were the anomaly. I was the mission. Yet you pulled me up. There is no calculation for that. It is a waste of energy. A risk with no measurable reward.”

Kiona thought of the river talking under the ice. Sly. Porous. Unpredictable. The most dangerous time.

“Maybe the reward isn’t for you to measure,” Kiona said.

She reached into her grandmother’s pouch. Her fingers bypassed the small bundles of herbs, the dried root, the smooth, river-worn stone. They found what she needed: a small, folded piece of birchbark. Inside was a coarse, greyish powder. She pinched some, leaned forward, and sprinkled it onto the fire.

The flame didn’t roar. It sighed. It deepened from orange to a profound, velvety blue at its heart, and a scent rose—clean, sharp, like pine after rain, but older, like the memory of a forest.

“Ts’i,” Kiona whispered. “For clearing.”

Lyn inhaled, her eyes widening slightly. The blue light danced in her pupils. “A chemical reaction. Aerosolized particulates altering combustion.”

“It’s for clearing,” Kiona repeated, simply.

They sat in the blue-tinged light. The vast, tracking eye of the sky felt farther away. The world shrank to the scent, the crackle, the solid rock beneath them, the boundary of their two tired bodies. Kiona felt the last of the adrenaline shiver leave her. In its place was a hollowed-out calm. She had crossed the river. She had destroyed the ghost’s purpose. She had pulled a woman from the rock. The case beside her was no longer a coffin for secrets, but a pack holding real things. This was her reward: not an object, but a silence. Not a power, but a pause. A window, open.

Lyn’s head nodded, then jerked up. Exhaustion and the remnants of the painkiller were pulling her under. Kiona nudged her.

“Lie down. Sleep by the fire. It’ll keep the tł'ih away.”

“The drones are not supernatural,” Lyn mumbled, even as she eased herself down, curling on her side, the white cast glowing in the dim light.

“Sure,” Kiona said. She pulled a foil emergency blanket from the med kit and draped it over her. “Tell that to my grandmother.”

Lyn was asleep in three breaths. Kiona stayed awake, feeding the fire, watching the stars wheel. The blue flame faded back to orange. The clearing was done. She felt, not happy, but present. A woman on a rock, under stars, with a fire. For this one night, it was enough.

The dawn came hard and glassy. The fire was grey ash. Lyn was still asleep, her face smoothed by unconsciousness, looking younger. Kiona’s body protested as she stood, every muscle a stiff, complaining cord. She walked to the edge of the shelf.

Below, the gorge was a slit of shadow, but the river’s roar had changed. It was louder, fuller, a sustained thunder rather than a chuckle. The real break-up was coming. She looked east, back the way they had come. The land folded into misty ridges, grey-green and endless. Her village was out there, beyond the horizon. Her grandmother, waiting by a cold stove.

She could go back. She had the real things. She had done the job, in her own way. The thought was a warm stone in her belly.

Then she looked west. The land rose in rumpled waves toward higher, snow-capped peaks. Somewhere out there was the drop she’d never made. A cabin. A man who was supposed to receive a black data drive. A man who worked for the people who sent ghosts. He would be waiting. He would have questions. Their questions were not kind.

The reward of silence had a price. The open window showed her the storm gathering on the horizon.

She heard a rustle. Lyn was sitting up, the foil blanket crinkling. Her eyes went to the gorge, to the sky, to Kiona. The blank confusion of the previous night was gone, burned away by sleep and pain. In its place was a sharp, brittle awareness. She was putting herself back together, but the pieces no longer fit the old blueprint.

“They will come,” Lyn said. It wasn’t fear. It was a systems report.

“I know.”

“The Warden had a black box. A deep-storage memory. It would have ejected upon catastrophic failure. It is likely still intact in the gorge. It will have recorded the final… anomaly.”

Kiona’s calm hardened into ice. A ghost’s last memory. Her face. Lyn’s. The dropped drive. The fight.

“How long?”

“The box emits a low-frequency pulse. A finder signal. They will have detected the Warden’s termination. A recovery team will already be tasked.” Lyn tried to stand, wobbled. Kiona moved to steady her. “Their priority will be the box. Then the secondary asset. Me. Then the courier. You.”

“The order of the kind questions.”

“Yes.”

The moment of respite was over, smothered by the cold, clear air of morning. The celebration had been a single, shared strip of meat by a blue flame. Now the shadow of the consequence was upon them, long and fast.

“We need to move,” Kiona said.

“My mobility is compromised. I will slow you down. Logically, you should proceed alone.”

Kiona was already repacking the oilskin bundle, kicking dirt over the ashes of the fire. “Logic got you a broken leg on a ledge. We’re going.”

“Why?” The question was pure, uncomprehending.

Kiona hefted the case. It was so light now. “Because I fed the hungry heart a stone. But stones give it indigestion. It’ll be coming back for something easier to swallow.” She nodded west. “Your man. The drop. He’s out there. He’ll have resources. Transport. Maybe a way to… explain your absence.”

“You want to walk into the destination?” Lyn asked, incredulity cutting through the pain.

“I want to see who’s been eating my face,” Kiona said. “And I want to give him a case full of nothing.”

It was a mad plan. A chaotic, inefficient path. Lyn stared at her, and Kiona saw the old protocols flare and die in her eyes, finding no purchase. There was no simulation for this.

Slowly, Lyn nodded. It was not agreement. It was acknowledgment of a new, terrible variable.

They moved as the sun cleared the peaks, a hard, white light that showed no mercy. Kiona supported Lyn, their pace a torturous shuffle over the rocky terrain. Every sound—the screek of a jay, the rush of wind in a gully—was the whine of a drone. Every glint of sun on wet stone was the lens of a tł'ih.

They had been moving for two hours when Lyn froze, her weight going rigid against Kiona.

“Listen.”

Kiona heard it. Under the wind, under the distant river. A low, rhythmic thrum, felt in the bones more than heard. It was the sound of the world having a heartbeat, and the heartbeat was mechanical.

They crouched behind a spill of boulders. Kiona peered through a crack.

It came from the south, a sleek, grey dragonfly of composite and silent rotor. It was larger than a scout drone. A transport. It moved with purpose, following the line of the gorge, then slowing, beginning a slow, spiraling descent.

“The recovery team,” Lyn breathed. “They’ve found the signal.”

They watched as the aircraft hovered, then settled somewhere out of sight, down in the ragged lip of the gorge. The thrumming idle of its engines was a corrupt vibration in the ancient air.

The shadow wasn’t just coming. It had landed.

Kiona’s hand went to her grandmother’s pouch, felt the solid shape of the river stone inside. A real thing. She looked from the hidden aircraft to the vast, trackless wilderness to the west. The open window now had a sentry posted outside.

The man at the drop would be waiting. The ghosts were picking through the wreckage. And she was here, in the middle, with a broken asset and a case full of sinew and stories.

Lyn’s voice was a dry whisper. “What is your protocol now?”

Kiona watched a tendril of dust rise from the gorge where the aircraft had settled. The hungry heart had indigestion, and it had sent its teeth to investigate.

She met Lyn’s eyes. “We run.”

---

 Chapter 7

 CHAPTER 7

The run was not a run. It was a stumble, a lurch, a desperate consumption of ground that tasted of iron and old snow. The mechanical heartbeat from the gorge was a bass note to their flight, a vibration that climbed the rock and up through the soles of Kiona’s boots. It said found, found, found.

Lyn was a ghost of efficiency, pain pared down to a sharp, focused light in her eyes. She said nothing, saving every atom of breath for motion. Kiona matched her, an arm around her waist, their two bodies moving as one clumsy, determined beast. They did not head west, toward the open wilderness. That was a dream now, a painting behind glass. The dragonfly had settled between them and that dream. Instead, Kiona angled them north, following the high shoulder of land above the gorge, keeping to the skeletal lee of granite spines and the brittle cover of last year’s fireweed.

The river was louder here. The thaw-song had become a wet, grinding argument. It covered the sound of their boots on scree, but it also covered the sound of anything that might be coming for them. The world was all mouth, talking over itself.

They had gone half a mile when the first shout echoed up from the gorge. A human sound, blunt and technological in its clarity. It was followed by another, and a burst of static-garbled speech. The teeth were talking to each other.

Kiona pulled Lyn down behind a fallen spruce, its roots a gnarled wall. They lay in the damp rot, breathing the smell of fungus and cold earth. Below, through a lattice of branches, they saw movement. Figures in grey environmental suits, moving with the unburdened purpose of wasps around a nest. They were clustered at a point on the opposite wall of the gorge. The wreckage. One figure pointed upward, tracing a line from the wreckage to the rim where Kiona and Lyn had been that morning. The gesture was a cold vector. It drew a line directly through their previous position.

“They have the trajectory,” Lyn whispered, her lips barely moving. “They’ll extrapolate a search cone.”

Kiona didn’t ask how she knew. The knowledge was in the flatness of her tone. This was procedure. The ghost finds the body, the teeth measure the wound, they calculate the spray. They were inside the cone now. Its point was widening, swallowing the land.

“We need to get across the river,” Kiona said.

Lyn’s head turned, her eyes sharp. “The ice is singing.”

“It’s still holding. Just. And they’ll expect us to avoid it. They’ll look for us trying to outrun them on land. The river is a door they think is locked.”

It was the kind of thinking her grandmother would call ǫǫ̀, the cunning of the hare that doubles back under its own scent. The thought of the old woman, alone in the cabin with the memory of the dawn drone, was a physical ache in Kiona’s chest. She pushed it down. That ache was a luxury for the still, for the safe.

They moved again, a slower, more agonizing traverse now, cutting downward toward the river’s roar. The land steepened, funneling them into a chute of broken shale that clattered and shifted like a pile of dry bones. Every sliding step was a announcement. They froze each time, becoming stone, but the river’s voice was a greedy ally, swallowing the smaller sounds.

They reached the bank where the ice was not a smooth sheet, but a chaos of upheaval. The thaw had swollen the water beneath, and the ice had buckled, creating a jagged landscape of blue-white plates and pressure ridges. It groaned, a deep-throated complaint from the planet’s joints. In the center, a black seam of open water churned, vomiting chunks of milky ice.

“There,” Kiona said, pointing upstream to where a massive sweep of driftwood—whole trees, stripped and pale—was frozen into the ice margin, creating a tangled blind. “We cross from behind that. The ice will be thicker near the shore debris. We go one at a time. You first.”

Lyn didn’t argue. She was a creature of thresholds now, of calculated risk. She nodded, her face pale as the ice. Kiona helped her down the final bank, through the brittle willows, and into the frozen cage of the driftwood. The world reduced to the roar, the groan, and the smell of wet stone and splintered pine.

Lyn stepped onto the ice. It was not a step, but a transfer of weight, an offering. The ice accepted it with a muffled grunt. She took another, arms wide for balance, her body a tense line of concentration. Kiona watched, her own breath held, as Lyn picked a path between the ridges, moving with the fragile grace of a insect on a pond skin. She was halfway across the seventy-yard span when the drone rose from the gorge.

It was the scout, the black wasp. It didn’t emerge from below them, but from downstream, having circled wide. It rose on a column of silent air until it hovered, a stark period against the white sky, a hundred yards away. It hung there, observing. The eye without a face.

Lyn saw it. She froze. A statue on the groaning plate.

Kiona’s hand was in her grandmother’s pouch, fingers closing around the river stone. A real thing. She didn’t throw it. She held it, its weight an anchor. See this, she thought at the drone. See a girl holding a rock. See nothing.

The drone pivoted, slightly. Its lens was a dark pupil. It was looking at Lyn.

Then it began to move. Not toward Lyn, but in a slow, sweeping arc toward Kiona’s position on the bank. It was methodical, painting the area with its sight. It would see her in the driftwood in three seconds.

Kiona did the only thing she could. She broke from cover.

She ran not onto the ice, but along the bank, away from Lyn, crashing through the willows with no attempt at stealth. She was a loud, clumsy animal, a distraction. The drone’s hum pitched higher. It changed course, locking onto her, accelerating.

“Kiona!” Lyn’s shout was torn away by the river.

Kiona ran. The bank was soft and treacherous, pocked with snow and frozen mud. She slipped, scrambled up, kept going. The drone was faster. It closed the distance, its shadow a jumping spider over the ground ahead of her. It wasn’t just observing now. It was herding. It drove her toward a bare, open stretch of bank where the trees fell away.

A second sound joined the river and the drone’s whine. The thrum-thrum-thrum of the transport’s engines, powering up from the gorge. The teeth were mobilizing.

Kiona skidded to a halt. The open bank was a trap. The drone hovered twenty feet away, a sentinel. Behind her, the way was blocked by a steep, muddy cut-bank. She was cornered.

The drone edged closer. From its underbelly, a slender manipulator arm unfolded, delicate and precise. At its tip, a hypodermic needle gleamed. Not just an eye. A stinger.

Protocol. Secure the asset. Neutralize the interference.

Kiona’s back was to the cut-bank. She had the river stone in one hand. The case with its sinew and stories was a heavy guilt on her back. The drone dipped, preparing its dart.

She didn’t throw the stone at the drone. She threw it at the cut-bank beside her, aiming for a thick seam of exposed, waterlogged soil just above her head. The stone struck with a wet thud. It did nothing.

The drone descended another foot, the needle orienting.

Kiona scrabbled at the bank, her fingers digging into the frozen mud, tearing at the seam. She pulled a great, dripping clod of earth free and hurled it, not at the machine, but into the air between them. It exploded in a shower of dirt.

The drone hesitated, its sensors momentarily confused by the particulate cloud.

Kiona dug again, heaving another mass of soil and root. She was not fighting the machine. She was fighting the bank, mining it, making a mess of the air. The drone weaved back, its precise programming offended by the chaos.

Then, with a sound like a giant’s stomach growling, the section of bank she was undermining gave way.

It wasn’t a collapse. It was a slump. A ton of saturated earth and rock peeled away from the riverside, carrying Kiona with it in a churning, roaring avalanche of mud. She was tumbling, drowning in cold earth, the world upended. She hit the river ice not as a person, but as a geological event.

The ice screamed.

A web of fractures lightninged out from the point of impact. The great plate shuddered. On the far bank, Lyn cried out.

Kiona was half-buried in the slide, spitting mud, her legs pinned by debris. The ice beneath her groaned, a sound of profound structural regret. The black seam of open water downstream widened, hungry.

The drone, having pulled up to avoid the slide, now repositioned. It dropped toward her again, stinger extended. It would dose her where she lay, let the cold and the mud finish the work.

A smaller rock struck its central rotor housing.

It was a perfect throw. It hit with a sharp tock. The drone wobbled, its hum turning ragged. It spun, seeking the source.

Lyn stood on the far bank, arm still extended. She had another rock in her hand. Her face was a mask of pure, furious defiance. She threw the second rock. It clipped a rotor blade. The drone’s flight became a drunken stagger.

It was the opening. Kiona heaved, ignoring the pain in her legs, wrenching herself free of the mud. She was on her hands and knees on the fractured ice. The cracks sang a high, terrible tune. She crawled, then staggered upright, aiming for the driftwood blind on the opposite shore, for Lyn.

The drone, recovering, ignored Lyn and shot after Kiona. But its flight was damaged, its trajectory a wobbling line. It overshot, corrected, and in that moment of mechanical confusion, it passed directly over the widening black seam in the ice.

From the open water, a long, gnarled branch—a snag from the bottom—rolled up in the current. It rose like a skeletal arm and caught in the drone’s landing struts.

The machine jerked. It tried to ascend, but the water-logged timber was a stubborn anchor. The rotors screamed, biting air, then water. For three seconds, it was a terrible, struggling creature. Then the cold river gulped it down. The black wasp was gone, leaving only a swirl of bubbles in the black water.

The silence it left was immense, filled only by the river’s roar.

Kiona reached the far bank. Lyn grabbed her arm, hauling her the last steps onto solid ground. They collapsed together in the snow, gasping, coated in mud and fear.

“The stone,” Kiona panted, patting her grandmother’s pouch. It was empty. “I lost it.”

Lyn just shook her head, her eyes on the gorge. The thrum of the transport was louder, angrier. A different sound now—the whine of terrestrial engines, of tracked vehicles. The teeth were coming on the ground.

“They’ll have seen that,” Lyn said. “They’ll come faster.”

Kiona pushed herself up. Her body was a ledger of complaints. “Then we stop running.”

Lyn stared at her. “Your protocol is to stand and fight?”

“No,” Kiona said, looking north, toward the distant, unseen ribbon of the winter road. “My protocol is to deliver the package. The man at the drop is still waiting. He’s our only exit. But the teeth are between us and him now. We can’t outrun their machines. So we make the machines irrelevant.”

“How?”

“We go where they can’t follow. We go into the old places.”

Lyn’s expression shifted. The asset recognized the parameters. “Non-technical terrain. Navigation hazards.”

“The Caves of the Children,” Kiona said. It was not a place you said lightly. It was a story-place, a ǫǫ̀ place, where the land ate sound and light and spat out confusion. “They run like veins under this ridge. They come out near the old landing strip. Near the drop.”

“You know these caves?”

“I know stories.” Kiona adjusted the case on her back. It felt heavier. “My grandfather got lost in them for three days. He said the stones in there… remember. He said they drink your light and give back echoes of things that haven’t happened yet.”

It was the kind of thing her grandmother would say. Lyn processed it not as poetry, but as data. “Acoustic anomalies. Magnetic interference. Sensor degradation.”

“Yes,” Kiona said. “All of that.”

The first vehicle, a low-slung tracked crawler with a composite hull, nosed over the rim of the gorge a quarter-mile downstream. A searchlight, pale in the daylight, swept the bank.

Kiona took Lyn’s hand. It was cold and firm. “We have to go into the dark. Can you do that?”

Lyn looked from the approaching light to Kiona’s mud-streaked face. She saw no protocol there. Only a terrible, specific will. She nodded.

They turned their backs on the river, on the light, and entered the tree line. The forest here was thick, a cathedral of spruce and shadow. They did not go far before Kiona found it: a cleft in a moss-covered rock face, half-hidden by a fallen hemlock. It was not a cave mouth, but a sigh. A slit in the world’s skin, exhaling air that was several degrees colder and smelled of damp stone and time.

Kiona pulled the hemlock boughs aside. The darkness within was absolute.

“Stay close,” she said, her voice already swallowed by the rock. “Don’t let go.”

She stepped in. Lyn, after the briefest hesitation, followed.

The light from outside lasted for three steps. Then it was gone, as if a door had been shut. The roar of the river vanished, replaced by a dense, ringing silence, punctuated by the drip of water somewhere in an unimaginable deep. The air was a cold blanket. Kiona flicked on her small headlamp. The beam was a pathetic thing, a child’s candle against the enormity of the dark. It showed a tunnel of smooth, water-sculpted limestone, narrowing ahead.

They moved in a bubble of frail light, their breath pluming in the beam. The cave did not consent to their passage. It tolerated it. The floor was uneven, slick with calcite. The walls pressed close, then opened into chambers so vast Kiona’s light could not find the ceiling, only catching on distant, gleaming stalactites like stone teeth in a giant’s maw. In these chambers, the silence had a texture. It was the sound of listening.

Lyn moved like a ghost beside her, her training making her footfalls silent. But her breathing was loud here. The cave made it loud.

“This is insane,” Lyn whispered, and the cave took the word, insane, and passed it back to them from three different directions, a soft, sighing argument.

“Don’t speak,” Kiona murmured. “The stones here… they like to talk.”

They went deeper. Kiona navigated by memory of stories, by the feel of the air moving (always go toward the moving air, her grandfather had said), by the ancient, invisible paths worn by water and time. She tried not to think of the weight of the mountain above them. She tried not to think of the case on her back, whose contents now felt less like data and more like a stolen piece of someone’s soul, brought into a place that knew all about souls.

After an hour, Lyn stopped. “Do you hear that?”

Kiona listened. Drip. Silence. The hum of her own blood. Then, faintly, a new sound. A vibration, coming through the rock. A distant, rhythmic thud-thud-thud. It was the transport’s engine, but muffled, translated by stone. It was above them. They were moving parallel to the search.

“They’re on the ridge,” Kiona said. “They know we didn’t cross the river further down. They’re guessing we’re in the trees.”

“They will have thermal,” Lyn said. “They will scan the mountain.”

“The rock is thick here. And cold. We’re a whisper in a freezer.”

They pressed on. The tunnel forked. Kiona chose the left-hand path, where the air smelled less stagnant. This path descended, coiling down in a tight spiral. The thud-thud-thud from above faded, replaced by a new sound: a low, subterranean wind, a sigh from the earth’s lungs. The air grew colder, sharper.

The tunnel opened into a chamber that made Kiona’s breath catch. Her headlamp beam skittered across a lake of absolute blackness, water so still it was a void. The chamber was vast, the far wall lost in darkness. Stalactites and stalagmites met in the center, forming a forest of stone columns. And the ceiling… the ceiling was covered in a glittering, crystalline frost. Not ice. Gypsum flowers, blooming in eternal winter.

It was breathtaking. It was a trap.

The path around the lake was a narrow ledge, slick with moisture. To the left, the black water. To the right, a sheer rock wall.

“Single file,” Kiona said. “Go slow. Test every step.”

Lyn went first, her hands pressed to the wall for balance. Kiona followed, her beam lighting Lyn’s careful feet. The ledge was uneven, sometimes crumbling. Pebbles dislodged by their boots plinked into the water below. The sound was deep, a lonely plonk that echoed for a long time.

They were halfway around when Kiona’s light caught something on the lake’s surface. A ripple. Then another. Not from their falling pebbles. From the center of the lake.

Something broke the water.

It was pale, long. A shape. It wasn’t an animal. It was a tendril of mist, coiling up from the blackness, glowing with a faint, internal bioluminescence. Then another. And another. Dozens of them, rising like ghostly fingers, waving in the still air. They pulsed with a soft, blue light.

Lyn froze. “What is that?”

Kiona’s grandfather’s story echoed in her head. “The Children,” he’d said, his voice hushed. “Not real children. The old things that live in the deep water. They look like lost souls. They are cold, and they are lonely. And they want you to join them.”

“Don’t look at them,” Kiona said, her voice tight. “Keep moving. Look at the wall. At your feet.”

But the light was mesmerizing. The tendrils—whether mineral, fungal, or something else—swayed, and as they swayed, they began to emit a sound. A faint, crystalline hum, just at the edge of hearing. It was a song without notes. It vibrated in Kiona’s teeth.

Lyn took a step, her foot slipping on the wet rock. She cried out, arms windmilling. Kiona lunged, grabbing the strap of Lyn’s pack, hauling her back from the edge. But the momentum was too much. They both stumbled. The case on Kiona’s back slammed against the rock wall.

The latch, stressed by the fall, the mud, the cold, gave way.

The case sprang open.

Kiona felt it happen—the sudden shift of weight, the click-pop. She twisted, but it was too late. The contents spilled out into the dark.

The data cores, the crystal drives, the sealed biostorage modules—they tumbled from the open case, bouncing on the narrow ledge. Some skittered toward the wall. Three, four, five of them arced over the edge and fell toward the black lake.

Time slowed. Kiona watched the most valuable, dangerous objects in her life—the reason for all of this—pinwheel in her headlamp beam. They struck the surface of the water not with a splash, but with a series of soft, final glugs.

They were gone.

The glowing tendrils near the impacts recoiled, then swarmed toward the sinking objects, coiling around them, their blue light intensifying, as if feeding on the strange, technological morsels.

Kiona stood, paralyzed, the empty case a hollow shell on her back. The mission, the deal, her way out—it was sinking into a primeval lake, wrapped in glowing tendrils. A scream built in her throat, a silent, useless thing.

Lyn was staring at the water, her face blank with shock. Then her eyes snapped to Kiona. Not with accusation. With a terrible, clear understanding.

The remaining items lay scattered on the ledge. A few data cores. The biostorage module that held the physical samples—the sinew. Maybe half the payload.

Kiona dropped to her knees, scrambling for them, her hands numb. She shoved them back into the broken case, forcing the latch closed. It wouldn’t hold. She tore a strap from her own pack, binding it shut.

When she looked up, Lyn was still staring at the water. The ghost-light played on her face.

“The mission…” Lyn began.

“Is compromised,” Kiona finished, the words ashes in her mouth. “I know.”

“Without the full dataset, the analysis is incomplete. The value is… fractional.”

Kiona stood, the patched case in her hands. It felt like a corpse. “What is your protocol now?” she asked, throwing Lyn’s old question back at her.

Lyn was silent for a long moment. The cave hummed around them. Finally, she spoke, her voice detached, analytical. “Asset recovery of a compromised package is low priority. Containment of loose ends becomes primary.”

Kiona understood. She was a loose end. Lyn, by association, was a loose end. The man at the drop would not be happy. He might not be paying. He might be cleaning.

“We can’t go to the drop,” Kiona said.

“No,” Lyn agreed. “We cannot.”

“Then we go out the other side. We disappear.”

“They will not stop looking. For the asset. For the data. For us.” Lyn’s eyes met hers in the gloom. “There is a protocol for this, too. For agents in the wind. They call it ‘gardening.’ You prune the problem. You burn the cuttings.”

The cold of the cave seeped into Kiona’s bones. “You’re saying they’ll kill us.”

“I am saying my value was the data in my head and the data in that case,” Lyn said, nodding to the bound shell. “One is damaged. The other is… attached to you. A liability. They will not spend resources to retrieve a liability. They will spend resources to erase it.”

The truth was a cold, clear lake of its own. They were not running to anything anymore. They were just running.

The crystalline hum from the lake intensified. The glowing tendrils had dragged the lost drives deep, their light now just a faint smear in the abyss. The cave had eaten its share.

“Come on,” Kiona said, her voice hollow. “We need to keep moving. The air is moving. There’s a way out.”

They continued, the joy of the mission extinguished, replaced by a grim, survivalist dread. The cave seemed to sense their despair. It tightened around them. The tunnels grew smaller, requiring them to crawl on hands and knees through icy runoff. Their clothes were soaked, their bodies shaking with cold and adrenaline crash.

Kiona’s headlamp began to flicker. The battery was dying. In the failing light, the shadows grew teeth.

After an age of crawling, the air changed. It smelled less of stone and more of pine and snow. A faint grey light seeped from ahead, not the white of day, but the gloom of twilight.

They emerged not with a dramatic exit, but with a crawl into a thicket of dwarf willow under a lowering sky. They were on the north side of the ridge. The land fell away in a series of frozen benches toward the wide, flat valley of the winter road. In the distance, Kiona could see the lonely, weathered shack of the old landing strip. The drop point.

It was maybe three miles away across open, snowy ground.

And between them and it, parked on the ridge a mere five hundred yards from their cave exit, was the grey transport dragonfly. Its engines were off. It sat silent, a sleeping metal insect. Near it, two figures in grey suits stood by a portable comms array, their backs turned.

They had outflanked the search. They had come out behind the sentry.

But the sentry was still there.

Kiona killed her headlamp. They lay in the willow thicket, watching. The wind had picked up, blowing snow in granular streams across the ground. It would cover their tracks. It would also hide any sound of their approach.

“We go around,” Kiona whispered. “Keep to the tree line. Work our way down to the road, then follow it to the strip from the east.”

Lyn shook her head. She was looking not at the transport, but at the landing strip shack. “He will be there. Waiting. Or his people will be. You no longer have what he paid for. You have a problem. I am a problem.”

“So we don’t go to him. We bypass the strip. We follow the road west. We walk out.”

“To where?” Lyn’s question was not despairing. It was a genuine request for data. “Your grandmother’s cabin is compromised. There is no ‘out’ in this wilderness that their satellites and drones cannot eventually find. We are tired, injured, and carrying a beacon of failure.” She nodded at the case.

Kiona knew she was right. The open window was gone. The world had shrunk to this frozen hillside, with enemies in front and behind, and a stolen future sinking in a cave lake.

One of the figures by the transport turned. He lifted a pair of field glasses, scanning the tree line. His gaze swept past their thicket, paused, swept back.

He had seen something. A movement. A glint.

He said something to his partner, pointing. Both figures turned. They began walking, purposefully, toward the thicket.

They were out of time.

“Run,” Kiona said.

But Lyn didn’t run. She reached over and placed a cold hand on Kiona’s arm. Her touch was startlingly gentle. “You have a choice. A final variable.”

“What choice?”

“Give me the case.”

Kiona stared at her. “What?”

“Their primary target is the asset and the data. I am the asset. The remaining data is there.” She looked at the bound case. “If I present myself, with the package, it will consume their attention. It is the protocol. Recover the priority. They will focus on secure extraction. You will be a secondary concern. A witness in the wilderness. You might slip through the cracks in the confusion.”

Kiona’s mind reeled. “They’ll kill you. You said it yourself. ‘Gardening.’”

“Perhaps. Or perhaps my value, even diminished, warrants repatriation and… debriefing.” The word was a euphemism that hung in the cold air, ugly and full of pain. “It is a calculated risk. Better odds than both of us dying out here in the snow tonight.”

The two grey suits were closer now, fifty yards away, their movements cautious but deliberate. They had unslung compact rifles from their shoulders.

“You’re betraying me,” Kiona said, the hurt raw and sudden.

“No,” Lyn said, and for the first time, her voice held a flicker of something that wasn’t analysis. It was sorrow. “I am using my function to create an exit. For you. It is the only piece of the mission that is not compromised. Your survival.”

“I won’t let you.”

“It is not your decision to make.” Lyn’s hand moved from Kiona’s arm to the strap of the case. Her fingers were deft. With a quick twist, she had it unclipped from Kiona’s grasp.

“Lyn, don’t!”

Lyn stood up.

She rose from the willow thicket, a pale, battered figure against the grey sky, the broken case held in both hands before her like an offering. Or a shield.

The two grey suits stopped. Their rifles came up, trained on her.

Lyn took a step forward, then another, walking steadily toward them, away from Kiona’s hiding place.

“Asset designation: Lyra,” she called out, her voice clear and empty on the wind. “Requesting secure extraction. Package is… degraded. But present.”

One of the suits spoke into his collar mic. The other kept his rifle aimed at Lyn’s center mass.

Kiona watched, buried in the frozen thicket, her heart a stone. She saw Lyn walk into the open, saw the suits close around her, one taking the case, the other gripping her arm. She saw Lyn look back, once, toward the thicket. Her face was calm. Resolved. Then she was turned, marched toward the waiting transport.

The dragonfly’s engines whined to life. The rotors began to turn, slowly at first, then blurring into grey discs. The wind from them blasted the snow into a stinging cloud.

Kiona pressed her face into the frozen earth. She heard the pitch of the engines rise, felt the vibration through the ground. When she looked up, the transport was lifting off, turning south, carrying its recovered asset and its degraded prize back toward the world of teeth and hungry hearts.

She was alone.

The sacrifice hung in the air, colder than the wind. Lyn had traded herself for a crack in the door. A variable.

Kiona waited until the sound of the engines had faded completely, eaten by the vast, indifferent land. Then, moving like an old woman, she pushed herself up. She had no case. No partner. No plan.

She had only the direction Lyn had given her: away.

She turned north, away from the landing strip, away from the road, away from everything. She walked into the gathering dusk, into the endless white. The ghosts had taken their payment. The river’s voice was a distant memory. The only sound was the crunch of her own boots in the snow, a tiny, persistent protest against the silence.

And the knowledge, a cold seed in her gut, that they were not done with her. A witness was still a loose end. And the wilderness, for all its size, was not big enough to hide from a heart that had learned to beat in a machine. It would send more tł'ih. It would send teeth.

But for now, there was only the next step. And the next.

Behind her, in the cave of lost children, in the deep, black water, the ghost-light pulsed around the sunken drives. And in the silence of stone, something began to remember. Something began to dream.

 Chapter 8

 CHAPTER 8

The silence was a third presence, walking beside her. It had been two days, or maybe three—the flat, grey light and the endless white had dissolved time into a single, stretching moment. Kiona moved through it like a needle through felt, leaving a trail of stitches the wind would soon pick out. Her grandmother’s words were a dry rattle in her skull: When the land is this quiet, it is holding its breath. Something is coming to fill the space.

The something was hunger, cold, and the raw, animal knowledge that she was being followed.

It wasn’t a sound. It was a subtraction. The absence of a bird call where one should have been. The way the snow-laden spruce branches stopped their creaking a moment too soon. A tł'ih did not need to make noise. It simply made the world around it quieter, sucking the life out of the air before it arrived. They were patient. They had the patience of a starved thing that knows its meal cannot run forever.

Her own patience was a frayed cord. Lyn’s sacrifice was a weight in her chest, a lump of cold iron that made every breath an effort. She had traded herself for a variable. For a crack. Kiona carried the crack with her, a splinter of impossible hope lodged in her heart, and it hurt more than the cold.

On the third day, the land began to change. The flat white tundra buckled and fell away into a jagged scar of a canyon, a deep, shadowed gash as if the earth had been clawed open. At its bottom, she could hear the faint, frantic chatter of open water—a river that had shrugged off its ice too early. The far side was a sheer wall of striated rock, impossible. Her way was blocked.

She stood at the crumbling edge, looking down. This was the end of ‘away’. The wilderness, for all its size, had funneled her here, to this precipice. It was a perfect place for an ending.

The hum arrived not as a sound, but as a vibration in her teeth. It was the taste of ozone and burnt plastic. She didn’t turn. She kept her eyes on the river below, a thin, black snake writhing in its bed of stone.

“Kiona Mose.”

The voice was smooth, genderless, filtered through a speaker. It came from behind and above. The hover-drone. Not the small, wasp-like scout, but a larger model, a mantis with long, jointed arms folded against its carbon-fibre belly. It hung in the air ten meters behind her, a black cross against the grey sky.

“You are a significant logistical anomaly,” the voice stated. The words were clean, surgical. “You will be retrieved.”

This was the teeth the machine-heart was sending. Not a squad of suits, but a single, efficient tool. A scalpel for a loose end.

Kiona slowly turned. The drone’s lens, a dark, multifaceted orb, regarded her without curiosity. It saw biomass. A problem to be corrected. She saw her own reflection, distorted and small, in its polished shell.

“My partner,” Kiona said, her voice rough from disuse. “Lyn. Where is she?”

“Asset Lyn Chen has been reconciled. Her value has been reabsorbed.” The drone tilted a degree. “Your value is negative. You are a debt.”

The words were meant to be final. A closing of the ledger. But in them, Kiona heard the lie. If she were just a debt, they would have fired a tranquilizer dart, a net, a bullet. They were talking. The machine was assessing. Lyn’s variable was at work. The crack was letting in a draft.

The drone unfolded one of its arms. A needle-tipped probe gleamed. “You will submit to a final audit. Neural compliance will streamline the retrieval.”

A final, purified test. Not of her strength, but of her self. They wanted to look inside, to see what the wilderness and the sacrifice had written there. To see if the crack had grown. And then they would seal it, with her silence.

Kiona took a step back. Her heel sent a pebble skittering over the edge into the void. There was nowhere to go but down.

“Submission is the optimal pathway,” the voice intoned. The drone drifted forward, the probe extending.

This was the moment. The corner. The purified test. She had no case, no partner, no plan. She had only what the land had given her: the memory of the river’s wet chuckle, the weight of her grandmother’s fear, the cold resolve in Lyn’s eyes as they took her. And the thing growing in the silence, the thing beginning to dream in the deep, black water.

She did not look at the probe. She looked at the lens. She let the cold seed in her gut unfurl.

“You send your tł'ih to watch,” she said, her voice low, merging with the wind. “But you don’t know what the tł'ih see. You only know what they report. You see without eyes. You have no heart to beat. You are a ghost asking a ghost for permission to exist.”

The drone paused. Its hover-stabilizers whined, adjusting. “Your semantic noise is non-productive.”

“My grandmother called you tł'ih,” Kiona continued, taking another step back. The edge was close. The river’s chatter was louder, hungry. “But a ghost is just a story that won’t stay buried. A memory that haunts. You took Lyn. You are a memory of that theft. And I,” she said, and now she smiled, a thin, cold crack in her own face, “I am the thing that remembers.”

She saw it then, in the data-stream of her own desperation. The ultimate evil was not the machine, nor the men who sent it. It was the silence it demanded. The reconciliation. The reabsorption. It was the end of stories. Lyn had not traded herself for a weapon or a code. She had traded herself for a story—the story of her own defiance, now a ghost in the system, a variable that could not be reconciled.

The drone’s arm shot forward, fast as a serpent’s strike.

Kiona didn’t try to dodge. Instead, she dropped. Not backward over the cliff, but straight down, collapsing onto the frozen ground. The probe hissed through the air where her neck had been. As she fell, her hand scrabbled in the snow, finding not a weapon, but a stone. A fist-sized, jagged piece of the ancient riverbed.

The drone corrected, dipping lower, its arm retracting for another strike. It was now directly over her, between her and the safe ground.

Kiona rolled onto her back, brought the stone up, and did not throw it at the drone’s body or its lens. She threw it, with all the strength of her despair and her remembering, at the canyon wall beside them.

The stone struck the exposed face of ice and rock with a sharp, insignificant crack.

For a second, nothing. The drone’s probe re-oriented, pointing at her heart.

Then the land answered.

The cliff face was not solid. It was a sheet of wind-slab over rotten ice, a giant, precarious tooth. The impact was the final tap. With a groan that started deep in the earth, a fracture line shot upward, zigzagging like white lightning. Then the whole face sheared away.

It fell not as a single piece, but as a roaring avalanche of ice, rock, and snow. A white tsunami.

The drone’s logic would have been perfect for a thousand scenarios. Evasion, pursuit, target acquisition. It was not prepared for the entire world to collapse beside it. It tried to rise, to dart away, but the violent downdraft of the falling mass caught it, slamming it downward. A boulder the size of a ground-car clipped one of its rotor arms. The carbon fibre splintered with a sound like a giant bone breaking.

Kiona was already moving, scrambling crab-like on her hands and heels, pushing back from the edge as the world disintegrated. Snow and debris blasted over her, a choking, blinding cloud. She buried her face in the crook of her arm, felt the ground shudder as thousands of tons of the canyon’s lip met the river far below.

The roar seemed to last forever. When it faded, replaced by a settling hiss of snow-dust, the silence returned. But it was a different silence. It was the silence after a great breath has been expelled.

Kiona pushed the snow off her back and raised her head.

The geography had been rewritten. The canyon’s edge was now a raw, scooped-out bowl. And ten feet from the new precipice, half-buried in rubble and snow, lay the tł'ih.

It was broken. One arm was gone. The other twitched, a spasmodic, mechanical gesture. Its carapace was cracked. From the fissures, thin tendrils of smoke escaped into the cold air. Its lens was dark, scoured by ice.

Kiona stood. She walked toward it, her boots crunching on the new snow. She stood over the broken machine. The ghost. It was just a thing now, a collection of parts leaking their life away. Defeated not by a greater weapon, but by the consequence of its own presence, the pressure it exerted on a fragile world.

The lens flickered. A faint, dying light within it. The speaker crackled, spitting static. Then a voice, stripped of its digital smoothness, raw and fragmented.

“...anomaly… un-reconciled… debt… un…”

The light guttered out. The twitching arm fell still.

Kiona looked from the machine to the vast, reshaped scar in the land. She had not defeated it with its own tools. She had remembered the land’s language. She had listened to its fragility and let the antagonist’s own weight be its end. The ghost was defeated by the truth of its own insubstantiality against the solid, brutal fact of the world.

She felt no triumph. Only a hollow, clean exhaustion. The cold seed in her gut was gone. In its place was a quiet, steady beat. Her own heart, no longer a frantic bird trapped in a cage of ribs, but a drum. A thing that marked time, that remembered, that moved forward.

She was reborn into the silence. Not as the girl fleeing the drone at her window, not as the courier with the case, not as the witness. She was Kiona, who had walked into the white and had a conversation with the edge of the world. She was the variable that had survived its own deletion.

She turned north again. The canyon was no longer a barrier. The avalanche had created a treacherous, sloping ramp of debris down to the river. A way across. A way forward.

She began the careful, painful descent. Each step was an integration. The fear, the grief, the cold—they were not gone. They were part of the rhythm now. The drumbeat of her heart encompassed them all.

She reached the river’s edge, the water black and swift with melt. She would find a way to cross. She would keep moving. The machine-heart would send more teeth, more ghosts. But it would be chasing the story now, not just the woman. And stories, once born into the world, were harder to kill than people.

As she picked her way along the shattered shore, a glint in the water caught her eye. Not a stone. Something smooth, manufactured. A piece of the drone’s carapace, perhaps, carried down by the avalanche. She knelt, reached into the biting cold of the water, and pulled it out.

It was not drone wreckage.

It was a data-drive. A small, sealed unit of black composite, identical to the ones from the case. It must have been thrown free in the explosion at the cave, carried by the subterranean water, and spat out here, in this new violence. A lost child, surfacing.

She held it in her palm, water dripping from her numb fingers. The ghost-light pulsed within it, a faint, blue heartbeat against the black.

The thing in the deep water was not just dreaming. It was sending out messages in bottles.

She closed her fist around it. The cold of it was electric. It was no longer a payload. It was an answer. And she was no longer a courier.

She was a question.

She tucked the drive inside her parka, against her skin. The cold was a shock, then a constant. A companion. She stood, looked up at the impossible climb on the far side, and began.

Above, in the flat, watching grey of the sky, a new sensor satellite, drawn by the seismic signature of the avalanche, finished its calibration. Its unblinking eye focused on the heat-blur of a single human form, a tiny, persistent protest against the white, climbing out of the scar. A new variable, now carrying a secret that hummed with its own ghost-light. A signal in the silence, waiting to be read.

The machine-heart had a new debt to calculate.

---

 Chapter 9

 CHAPTER 9

The climb was a kind of drowning in air. Each handhold was a gasp, each ledge a shallow breath before the next pull upwards. The avalanche had scoured the mountain’s face raw, leaving a treachery of loose scree and fractured bone-rock. Kiona moved through it like a needle through torn hide, a slow, deliberate stitch. The cold of the data-drive was a brand against her sternum, a second, slower heart. It did not warm. It simply persisted, a piece of deep winter lodged inside her coat.

She crested the final ridge as the weak sun bled out behind the western peaks. The world below was not the one she had left.

The valley was a wound. The avalanche had not stopped at the river; it had leapt the gap, a white tsunami of snow and rock that had slammed into the opposite tree-line and sheared it off. The familiar path of the caribou, the stands of black spruce where she’d set snares as a girl, were gone. Buried or splintered. A raw, brown scar stretched for a kilometer, a brutal geometry of ruin. The river, choked with ice and debris, had backed up into a swollen, angry lake, its surface a chaos of grinding pans.

But at the northern edge of the destruction, where the old growth still stood sentinel, there was smoke. Not one thread, but several, braiding together in the twilight air. Council smoke. The kind you lit when the world broke and people needed to remember how to be a circle.

Her body understood before her mind. The ache in her shoulders unlocked. The vigilance in her neck, the constant strain of listening for the wasp-drone’s whine, softened by a degree. She was not coming home to a silent cabin, to a grandmother’s fearful whisper. She was coming to a fire.

The descent was faster. Her legs, rubbery from the climb, found a stubborn rhythm. She entered the tree-line, the sudden hush of snow-laden boughs a balm after the open violence of the scar. The smell of woodsmoke and boiling meat grew stronger, cutting through the clean, empty scent of snow. She followed it to the clearing behind Old Man Talir’s cabin.

They were all there. Or what was left of them. Talir, his face a map of deeper wrinkles than she remembered, turning a caribou haunch on a spit over a central fire. Martha Aviq, mending a torn parka by the light of a propane lantern, her fingers never pausing. The Denoon kids, quiet for once, stacking split wood. And in a chair pulled close to the heat, wrapped in a mountain of blankets, her grandmother. Nana’s eyes were on the flames, but they were not empty. They were waiting.

Kiona stepped into the ring of light.

All movement stopped. The spit halted its turn. The needle froze mid-stitch. The children became statues of shadow and flame. It was Talir who broke the silence, not with a word, but with a slow, deep nod. It was an acknowledgment of an arrival, not an intrusion. Martha set her mending down.

Nana looked up. Her eyes found Kiona’s, travelled over the crust of ice on her pants, the raw scrape on her cheek, the way she stood, rooted yet ready to fall. She did not smile. She opened the blankets.

Kiona went to her. She knelt in the snow by the chair, the heat of the fire on one side, the frail, electric heat of her grandmother on the other. A work-roughened hand came out and touched her hair, her cheek, as if verifying she was made of solid matter and not river-mist.

“The river spoke your name last night,” Nana said, her voice the rustle of dry leaves. “A loud word. I heard it in the stones under the house.”

“It was the mountain speaking,” Kiona said, her own voice strange to her, graveled by cold and disuse. “Giving up a tooth.”

Talir resumed turning the spit. The hiss-pop of fat hitting the coals was a domestic, holy sound. “We felt it shake the roots. Saw the white cloud swallow the sky. We thought it had taken you into its mouth.”

“It tried.” Kiona sat back on her heels, the weight of the drive against her chest a palpable secret. The ordinary world was here—the smell of meat, the pile of mending, the stacked wood—but it was perched on the edge of the new scar. It was an island. And she had brought the sea with her. “The ghosts followed me to the high pass. One of them… woke the mountain up.”

Martha Aviq picked up her needle again. “The black wasps. They have been thick these past days. Circling. Not coming close, but watching. Like crows before a storm.”

“They are looking for a story that got away from them,” Kiona said. The words felt too large for the firelight. But this was the place for large words. This circle was the oldest container they had.

Her grandmother’s hand found hers, squeezed. “You have it?”

Kiona looked at the faces, etched by firelight and a shared, unspoken understanding. They had not asked where she had been, what she had carried. They had only seen her go, and now they saw her return, marked by the mountain. They were the welcome that did not demand, the recognition that asked no proof. It was the first true warmth she had felt, and it made the cold of the drive feel like a betrayal.

“I did,” she said, the truth a half-thing, a shadow on the rock. “It’s gone. The mountain has it now.” This was not a lie. It was one layer of the story. The case was buried under a thousand tons of grief-stone. That truth was solid.

Nana watched her, eyes like chips of obsidian. She saw the shadow. She always did. But she only nodded, slowly. “Good. Let the mountain digest it. Its stomach is stronger than ours.”

The tension around the fire eased a fraction. The story was acceptable. A courier had been chased, the payload lost to an act of God. It was a clean, old ending. Talir began carving the meat, handing out slabs on pieces of bark. The children were summoned, given their share. Conversation turned, with deliberate care, to the business of survival. The caribou Talir had taken just before the slide. The state of the fish caches by the lake, now under three meters of snow-slurry. The best route to the next trapline, now that the old one was a tomb of ice.

Kiona ate. The meat was rich, life-giving. She listened. This was the rhythm, the drumbeat of community. It was real, and she clung to it. But under her parka, the drive pulsed its silent, blue heartbeat. A counter-rhythm. A secret drum.

She was not the same woman who had left. The circle held her, but she was a warped spoke. She had crossed the river at its most dangerous whisper. She had been seen by a satellite’s unblinking eye. She had held a thing that dreamed in the dark and now carried a piece of its dream. The ordinary world welcomed her, but she could no longer fully enter it. She was a question, sitting by their fire, eating their meat.

When the meal was done, and the children were sent to bed in Talir’s back room, and Martha began boiling water for pine-needle tea, Nana’s hand tightened on Kiona’s again.

“You are tired in your bones,” she stated. “But your spirit is not sleeping. It is watching a different door.”

Kiona met her gaze. She could not share the drive. To bring it into the light here would be to draw the wasps to this fire, to this circle of mending and meat. It would be the deepest debt. But she could share the weight of it. Not the object, but the shape of the burden.

“The thing I carried,” Kiona said, her voice low, for her grandmother’s ear alone. “It was not just a tł'ih’s trinket. It was… a memory. A memory of the deep earth, older than rivers. The people who sent the wasps, they wanted to bury that memory. To keep it silent.”

Nana was still, her eyes reflecting the dance of the flames. “A memory has a voice. It wants to be heard.”

“This one does,” Kiona whispered. The confession was a relief, a stone lifted from her tongue. “It spoke. And the mountain listened.”

Her grandmother was silent for a long time. The fire cracked. Across the clearing, Talir and Martha spoke in low tones about hinge-wood for a new sled.

“You did not lose all of it,” Nana said finally. It was not a question.

Kiona’s hand went, involuntarily, to her chest. The gesture was answer enough.

Nana’s breath left her in a long, slow sigh, a sound of resignation and a strange, grim pride. “A story that wants to live will find a carrier. It is a heavy gift. You cannot bring it into the house. But you cannot leave it outside in the snow. It will freeze, or it will be taken.” She looked into the fire, her face ancient and unreadable. “You must build a new house for it.”

The words settled into Kiona, making sense in a way that was beyond logic. A new house. Not here. Not in the ordinary world. But not out in the exposed wild, either. A threshold place.

“Where?” Kiona asked.

“You will know,” Nana said. “The story will show you. It is not our story. Not yet. But you are its bridge.” She turned her head, her eyes sharp. “The wasps will know you have it. Their eyes are everywhere. You must move like the river under the ice. You must be a voice they cannot catch.”

It was the sharing of the elixir, but not as she had imagined. Not a triumphant bestowal of wisdom, but a quiet, fearful conferral of a dangerous truth. The healing was not for the community—not yet. The healing was the act of speaking the secret into the space between them, of having it heard and held by the one person whose understanding was absolute. It was a transfusion of purpose. Her grandmother did not take the burden. She gave Kiona the strength to carry it.

Martha brought them tea. The ordinary world closed back in. They drank in silence, the three elders and the woman who was now something else. The talk returned to practicalities. Kiona would stay the night. In the morning, Talir would lend her his good snowshoes; hers were lost to the mountain. They would give her what supplies they could spare.

It was a sending-off, but not a banishment. It was an acknowledgment that her path now diverged from the well-trodden circle around the fire. She had a different rhythm to walk to.

Later, in the loft under a pile of furs, Kiona lay awake. The drive was on the floor beside her, wrapped in a scrap of waxed canvas. Its faint pulse was invisible, but she could feel it, a vibration in the floorboards. A signal in the silence.

She was no longer a courier. The Company’s debt was a ledger entry in a machine-heart far away, a cold calculation of assets lost. She was a question. And now, she was a bridge. The new house for the story had to be built, a place where a deep-earth memory could be heard without bringing the sky down on the people by the fire.

Her mind turned, not south towards the Company’s enclaves, but north. To the old places. The listening posts that had gone silent not with a bang, but with a slow, frozen sigh. To the ghost-towns of the last century’s fever-dream, where the wires were dead but the structures might still stand. A place in the ruins, where a new signal could be hidden among the echoes of old ones.

The satellite had seen her climb out of the scar. It would be tracking her heat-signature, predicting her vector. It would expect her to flee to population, to cover. It would calculate her debt and her fear.

So she would not flee. She would go deeper. Into the white silence where the machine-heart’s models grew thin, where the old maps said here there be giants. She would become a glitch in its vision, a persistent, inexplicable heat-blur moving towards the cold, dark heart of the forgotten world. She would build her new house from the bones of the old one.

Outside, the wind picked up, moaning through the shattered valley. It was a clean sound, a scouring sound. It carried away the scent of woodsmoke and meat, replacing it with the endless, empty breath of the north.

Kiona closed her eyes. The ghost-light of the drive, muffled in canvas, pulsed against her closed lids. A message in a bottle. And she was the current that would carry it to a shore no one was watching.

In the flat, watching grey of the sky, the sensor satellite traced the stationary heat-source clustered at the coordinates of Talir’s cabin. It logged the presence of multiple human signatures. It identified one as a 78% match for the variable designated Kiona-747. The machine-heart noted the convergence, calculated the increased metabolic and social probability of the variable remaining stationary for 12-48 hours. It adjusted its predictive algorithms. It tasked two Reaper-class drones, currently monitoring seismic activity in Sector Gamma, to divert and establish a high-altitude, low-observability watch perimeter around the location.

The variable was dormant. The debt was stationary. The equation was balancing.

The machine-heart did not dream of deep water, or of memories in stone. It dreamed of closure. Of neat lines connecting cause to effect, asset to loss, variable to zero. It sent its silent, patient ghosts to ring the firelight, to wait for the variable to move, to re-enter the stream of logic.

It waited for the story to make sense.

And deep beneath the ice, in the dark where the pressure shaped time into new forms, the dreamer stirred. A fragment of itself had surfaced. It had been found. The carrier was moving. The signal was in the world. It was a weak pulse, a single neuron firing in a vast, cold body. But it was a beginning.

It sent out another pulse, not a memory this time, but a resonance. A tuning fork struck in the abyss. It traveled through the bedrock, a subtle harmonic, seeking the signature of its own lost piece.

The stone beneath Talir’s cabin hummed, a note too low for human ears.

Kiona, on the edge of sleep, felt it in her teeth.

 Chapter 10

 CHAPTER 10

The hum was in the walls.

Kiona woke with it, a vibration in the marrow of her jaw, a pressure behind her eyes. It wasn’t a sound. It was the ghost of a sound, the memory of a frequency that had already passed through the log walls, the stone foundation, the flesh and bone of her sleeping body. She lay on the floor by the cooling stove, wrapped in a caribou hide, and stared at the smoke-stained ceiling. The dreamer in the deep was tuning itself. And she was the reed.

Across the room, Talir snored softly, a ragged, human rhythm against the subsonic thrum. Her grandmother was a still mound under blankets on the cot, but Kiona could see her eyes were open, reflecting the dull red embers through the stove’s grate. Watching the dark.

The drone-light was gone from the window. The silence outside was a different kind of noise—the held breath of something waiting. The machine-heart had drawn its circle. She’d felt its logic like a cold draft when the satellite’s eye had passed over them last night, a statistical gaze that pinned them like specimens. Dormant variable. Stationary debt. She’d carried the drive here, a splinter of ancient memory, and in doing so, she had made this cabin a target. She had painted a circle around everyone she had left.

The practical work was a relief. It was a knife to cut the eerie tension. At first light, she banked the fire, melted snow for water. The hum had faded, or she had grown accustomed to it, a new permanent ringing in the silence of her head. She checked the perimeter, not with her eyes, but with her body, listening for the absence of natural sound—the gap where a bird call should be, the hollow space in the wind where a Reaper’s rotors weren’t. She found nothing. That was the point. The ghosts were polite. They didn’t rattle the windows. They just made the world outside feel like a diorama behind glass.

Talir stirred when the smell of pine needles and boiling water filled the cabin. He sat up, his face creased and old in the grey dawn. He looked at Kiona, then at the old woman on the cot. No greeting. Just a slow, assessing nod. He saw the hum in her, too.

“The water speaks today,” he said, his voice gravelly with sleep.

Her grandmother turned her head on the pillow. “It is not the water. It is the bone of the world. It aches.”

“The drive,” Kiona said, the word too sharp, too modern in the close, smoky air. She pulled the canvas-wrapped brick from her inner pocket, where it had pressed against her ribs all night. It was warm. Not from her body heat. A chemical warmth, like a stone left in the sun. “It’s… responding. To something down there. Or something down there is responding to it.”

Talir held out a hand. She placed the bundle in his palm. He didn’t unwrap it. He held it, his eyes closed, his head tilted as if listening to a shell. After a long minute, he opened his eyes. “It is a piece of a story. A story that broke. The break is sharp. It cuts both ways.” He handed it back. “You cannot keep a splinter in your flesh. It will work its way in, or work its way out.”

“I have to get it to the coast. To the Annie M.” She named the old supply trawler that still made the risky spring run up to Tulu Bay. “Marlow might still be crazy enough to make the trip.”

“Marlow is dead,” her grandmother said from the cot, matter-of-fact. “His son runs the boat now. He has a machine that listens to the sky. He calls it insurance.”

A son. A new machine. The world kept updating itself, leaving older, simpler versions behind. Kiona felt a surge of useless anger. “Then I’ll find another way.”

“The ghosts outside will find it first,” Talir said. He rose, stiffly, and poured himself a cup of the pine-needle tea. “You moved fast, alone. You were a single fish in a big river. Now you are a stone in a pool. The ripples are easy to see. They,” he nodded toward the window, toward the empty sky, “they like things that stay still. It makes the math quiet.”

The first scene of her new reality was this: the three of them, trapped in a cabin by invisible walls of data and prediction. The victory of the night before—the sharing of the memory, the solid, undeniable truth of it—was now a liability. The convergence the machine-heart had logged. She had to un-converge. She had to break the pattern its logic was so comfortably settling into.

“We need to scatter,” she said. “Like ptarmigan in a hawk’s shadow. You go north to the ridges, Grandmother. Talir, you have that line cabin up on the Black Knife. Go. Be separate heat signatures. Be moving variables.”

Her grandmother pushed herself up on one elbow. Her eyes were fierce. “You think I run from tł'ih? This is my home. My bones are in this ground.”

“Your bones won’t do you any good if a hellfire missile turns this cabin into a hole,” Kiona snapped, the fear making her voice cruel. She saw the old woman flinch, and hated herself. She softened her tone. “It’s not running. It’s… changing the story. The story they are telling about us right now is about three people hiding with a secret. We need to give them three different stories to tell.”

Talir sipped his tea. “She is not wrong, Elna. The young wolf understands the trap. She smells the steel.”

He used her grandmother’s name, a sound Kiona had almost forgotten. Elna. It made her real in a new way, separate from grandmother, a person with a history that didn’t include Kiona at all. Elna glared at him, then sank back onto the pillow, conceding. “I will go to Mary Aklok’s. She is old and her stove smokes. Their seeing-machine will think it is just a fire that is always lit. A story of nothing.”

It was a good idea. A clever corruption of the data-stream. A smudge on the lens.

“And you?” Talir asked Kiona.

“I become a fish again. I move. Tonight.” She looked at the drive in her hand. The warm, sleeping splinter. “But I need a decoy. Something for their ghosts to follow if they get impatient.”

Talir’s eyes, deep-set and dark, gleamed. He set down his cup. “I have an idea for a story they will like very much.”

The second scene was carved with knives and silence.

Talir worked on the decoy at the table, his big, scarred hands moving with a surgeon’s precision. He didn’t use modern tools. He used an ulu, its half-moon blade sharp enough to part hair. He used a length of old copper wire, a strip of waterproof canvas from his pack, a lump of pine pitch he warmed by the stove.

Kiona watched, mesmerized. He wasn’t making a replica of the drive. He was making a story of the drive. A story the machine-heart would recognize. He took a stone from the hearth—a smooth, river-worn piece of granite the size of his palm—and wrapped it tightly in the canvas. He sealed the seams with pitch. He embedded the copper wire in the pitch, leaving a short, stiff protrusion that looked like a crude data-port. He weighted the bundle with a lead fishing sinker, so it had the right heft. Then, with the ulu’s point, he etched a tiny, meticulous pattern into the hardened pitch. It looked like circuitry. It looked like the frost feathers on a windowpane. It was a perfect cipher—technological enough to trigger recognition algorithms, organic enough to be plausible as something ancient and strange.

“They see from so far away,” he murmured, not looking up. “They see heat, shape, mass. They see patterns. They do not see this.” He tapped his temple. “They do not see a lie told by an old man at a table.”

It was a act of profound subversion. It was a virus made of pitch and stone. Kiona felt a swell of something like awe. This was the deepening. Talir was no longer just a keeper of old memories; he was an active forger in the war of narratives. He was writing a false page for the machine-heart’s ledger.

Her grandmother, Elna, was packing a small bag with a quiet fury. She folded a change of clothes, a packet of hardtack, her own tin cup. She moved around Kiona like a weather system, radiating a potent mix of fear, pride, and resentment. The loose end between them wasn’t the past anymore—it was the future. A future Kiona was dictating.

Finally, Elna stopped in front of her. “You carry a piece of the deep in your pocket,” she said, her voice low. “And you think you are leading it. But maybe it is leading you. Maybe it called you to the river. Maybe it called the tł'ih to your window. You are a woman, not a current. You can choose to put the stone down.”

“And do what?” Kiona asked, her throat tight. “Let it be lost again? Let the story be only theirs? You saw. You felt it. That memory is… it’s a truth. It’s a person. Not a thing.”

Elna’s hand came up, quick as a bird, and gripped Kiona’s wrist. Her fingers were strong, the skin papery and cool. “A person who lived and died under that ice a thousand lifetimes ago. Their truth is not more important than your life. My life.” She let go, but her eyes held on. “You think you are saving a story. I think you are feeding one to a mouth that is always hungry. The machine does not care if the story is true or false. It only cares that it can be consumed. Made into a number.”

It was the clearest articulation of the anxiety that had lived in Kiona’s gut since the drone first hovered at her window. The fear wasn’t of surveillance, or of capture. It was of assimilation. Of having the wild, wet, singing truth of the memory—of the river, of the dreamer, of her own journey—processed into a quiet, stationary data-point. A closed ticket.

“I have to try,” Kiona said, and it sounded feeble, childish.

Elna sighed, the anger leaving her like a tide going out, leaving only a vast, weary shore. She reached into the neck of her dress and pulled out a thin leather cord. Hanging from it was a small, carved piece of ivory—a diving loon, its lines worn smooth by generations of skin. “My mother gave me this. It is for seeing clearly in dark water.” She looped it over Kiona’s head. The loon rested cold against Kiona’s sternum. “Do not just look. See.”

It was a redefinition. Not a blessing, but a tool. An allyship forged not in agreement, but in the stark, clean love of a warning given. Kiona nodded, unable to speak. The hum in the walls seemed to swell for a moment, agreeing.

By late afternoon, the pieces were set. Talir’s decoy was complete, a dark, enigmatic lump that seemed to suck the light from the room. He had also fashioned a second, identical pouch from scrap leather, empty. “For the true one,” he said. “A twin. Confusion is a good friend.”

Kiona transferred the warm drive to the empty pouch, feeling its resonant heat through the leather. She put it back inside her jacket. The decoy went into an outer pocket.

The plan was simple, brutal in its geometry. At twilight, Elna would leave first, heading east toward Mary Aklok’s, a journey of a few hours on snowshoes. An hour later, Talir would leave, heading northwest into the rugged hills, carrying the decoy in a prominent place on his pack. He would move fast, leaving a clear thermal trail, a beacon of interesting data. Kiona would wait until full dark, then slip out and head due south, toward the coast and the hope of a boat.

They ate a last meal of stew in silence. The cabin, which had felt like a sanctuary, now felt like a cell counting down to its own abandonment. The fire popped. The wind picked up, keening under the eaves. The machine-heart’s ghosts were out there, listening to the weather, listening to their heartbeats through the walls.

Elna left as the sun bled out along the western ridges. She did not look back. She became a small, dark, determined shape, swallowed by the blue shadows of the spruce. Kiona watched from the window until there was nothing to watch.

Talir checked his gear, his face a mask of concentration. “The decoy will sing to them,” he said. “It has a… smell. The copper, the pitch. Their sniffers will taste it on the wind from five miles up. They will like my story better than yours. It is louder.” He hoisted his pack. At the door, he paused. “The hum you feel. The dreamer. It is not calling you, Kiona-747.” He used the variable name without irony, a cold label. “It is calling its piece home. You are the path. Remember that. A path can be walked, or it can be washed away. Be the walking.”

Then he was gone, too, and the cabin was hollow.

Kiona was alone with the ticking stove and the subsonic pulse in her teeth. She was the dormant variable, about to reactivate. The equation was about to be unbalanced. She felt a strange, electric clarity. This was the shattering. Not a battle, but a fragmentation. A single, clear story—the girl with the drive in the cabin—was splitting into three divergent, messy, human tales. It was a denial of the machine-heart’s deepest desire: for a neat, convergent solution.

She waited in the growing dark, feeling the true drive against her ribs. It was warmer than before. It seemed to beat in time with the low thrum from below. A tuning fork struck in the abyss. She was carrying the struck note. And somewhere, the great, waiting body of the dreamer was listening for its echo.

Full dark. The third scene began with a silent door and a colder wind.

Kiona slipped out, leaving the stove to die behind her. She carried nothing but a small daypack with a little food, the water bottle, and the knife. She wore white, an old snow-smock of Talir’s that smelled of smoke and man. She was a ghost against the snow, moving south, using the starless gloom of the tree-line for cover.

For the first hour, the world was merely winter. The crunch of her snowshoes, the saw of her own breath, the immense, indifferent sky. She listened for the wrong sound—the electric whine of a quad rotor, the faint Doppler whimper of a satellite passing overhead. She heard nothing but the forest settling into its night bones.

She made good time, her body falling into the old, long-distance rhythm. The hum was a constant companion, a private frequency only she could hear. She thought of Elna, arriving at Mary Aklok’s, telling some cover-story about a quarrel with Talir. She thought of Talir, moving fast and high, a dark beacon on a thermal scan, leading a chorus of ghosts on a wild goose chase across the knife-edge ridges. She hoped his story was a good one. She hoped the machine-heart found it utterly compelling.

She crested a low rise and paused in the lee of a granite outcrop. Below her lay a wide, frozen muskeg, a plain of white under the vague ambient light of the cloud-choked sky. The direct route south went straight across it. Two miles of exposure.

The anxiety was a chemical taste on her tongue. Technology’s gaze loved open ground. It was a clean, well-lit room for its algorithms. The forest was messy, full of false positives—animals, shifting snow, heat-sinks in rocks. The muskeg was a spreadsheet.

She could go around, adding hours. Or she could go across, a swift, silent dart through the open field of its vision.

She chose the field. It was an act of defiance. A gamble that its eyes were elsewhere, fixed on Talir’s louder, more interesting signal. She took a deep breath, adjusted her pack, and stepped out from the trees.

The silence on the muskeg was absolute. Deeper than in the woods. Her snowshoes made a soft, rhythmic swish-crunch, swish-crunch. She felt like the only moving particle in a vast, still experiment. Halfway across, the hum in her teeth intensified. Not a pulse, but a sustained note, rising in pitch. The drive against her chest grew hot, almost uncomfortably so. She clutched it through her layers, fearing it would glow, would become a beacon in the infrared.

Then she saw the light.

Not in the sky. On the ice. A soft, greenish-blue shimmer, emanating from the frozen surface of a shallow pond to her left. It pulsed in time with the hum. It was the same light from the memory-vision—the dreamer’s light. It was here. A seepage. A response to the fragment she carried.

She froze, mesmerized and horrified. It was beautiful. It was a catastrophic signature. Any spectral sensor, any low-light camera would flag it as an anomaly. A bloom of bioluminescence in a frozen sub-arctic muskeg was a screaming outlier in the data-set.

She had to move. Now. She broke into a clumsy, snowshoeing run, veering away from the glowing pond.

From above, and from nowhere, came a sound. Not the whine of a drone. A soft, profound thump. Like a giant heart beating once, deep in the earth.

The ice beneath her feet shuddered. Not a crack, but a wave. A single, rolling tremor that traveled through the frozen mat of grass and peat and water. It knocked her off her feet. She landed hard on her side, the breath driven from her lungs.

The hum in her teeth spiked into a silent scream. The light from the pond flared, then died abruptly.

And then she heard the other sound. The one she had been waiting for and dreading. A sound like a giant, mechanical mosquito. Distant, but closing fast. From the north. From the direction Talir had gone.

They hadn’t taken his bait. Or they had, and they’d left a ghost to watch the empty stage anyway. And she had just lit a flare on it.

She scrambled up, her heart a frantic drum against the drive’s heat. She was a sitting duck on the white plain. The tree-line on the far side was a dark smudge, a mile away. The thump-whine of the drone was louder, triangulating.

Then, a new light. Not from below. From above. A thin, focused beam of white light, piercing the clouds from a great height. It didn’t sweep. It pinned. It painted a perfect, dazzling circle on the ice twenty yards to her right. A spotlight from a Reaper flying at the edge of the stratosphere. It wasn’t trying to illuminate her. It was marking her. For the smaller, quicker drone. Or for something else.

The message was clear: We see you. You are not hidden. You are a variable in a lit circle.

This was the new threat. Not pursuit, but designation. She was no longer a blip to be tracked. She was a target to be contained. The technological anxiety crystallized into a perfect, diamond-hard truth: the system didn’t need to chase you. It just needed to paint you, and let your own panic, your own desperate movement, tell it everything it needed to know.

She did the only thing she could. She stopped running. She stood still in the white smock, in the vast white field, under the white, piercing eye from heaven. She became a statue. She let her breathing slow. She let the cold seep into her bones. She was a rock. A snow-drift. A stationary, uninteresting thing.

The spotlight held its circle on the ice, unwavering. The smaller drone’s whine circled somewhere in the dark behind the clouds, confused. The logic was disrupted. The variable had stopped. The story had halted.

Deep in the earth, the dreamer sent another pulse. This one was different. Not a hum, but a command. A single, resonant note that seemed to bypass her ears and speak directly to the ancient, reptile part of her brain.

Down.

Without thought, Kiona dropped. Not to the ice, but into a shallow, snow-filled depression beside a frozen tussock. She burrowed, pulling snow over herself, making herself part of the landscape’s texture. The drive was a furnace against her skin.

The spotlight circle quivered, then began to move. It slid across the ice, searching, probing. It passed over her depression. The light was blinding even through the snow. It paused. She held her breath, her body screaming to run. The loon carving felt like ice on her chest.

Then, from the far tree-line—Talir’s direction—a brilliant flash of orange light. A sudden, roaring bloom of heat. A fire. A huge one. Talir’s story had just gotten explosive.

The spotlight snapped away from her, racing across the muskeg toward the new, urgent, data-rich signal. The smaller drone’s whine changed pitch and shot away toward the fire.

Kiona didn’t wait. She erupted from the snow and ran, not with panic, but with a terrible, focused grace. The tree-line rushed to meet her. She hit the dark wall of spruce and dove into it, crashing through branches, not caring about noise now, only about depth, about getting lost in the messy, chaotic, living data of the woods.

She ran until her lungs were strips of torn leather. Then she collapsed against a tree trunk, gulping air, listening.

Silence. The spotlight was gone. The drones were gone, drawn to Talir’s magnificent, sacrificial fiction. He had given her a door. He had set himself on fire to do it.

She touched the drive through her clothes. It was cooling. The hum was gone. In its place was a new sensation: a pull. A gentle, insistent tugging, like a compass needle finding north. But this north was not on any map. It was downward, and south-southwest. Toward the coast, yes. But toward a specific point on the coast. The dreamer wasn’t just calling its piece home anymore. It was giving her directions.

The status quo had not just changed. It had inverted. She was no longer a carrier on a map of her own choosing. She was a needle being drawn to a magnet in the deep. The machine-heart had its stories—of a fire in the hills, of a stationary debt, of a variable momentarily lost. But beneath its logic, beneath the ice and the stone, a older, slower story was re-knitting itself. And she was the thread.

She got to her feet. She adjusted the pack. She felt the cool ivory loon against her skin. See clearly in dark water.

She looked south, into the tangled, breathing dark of the forest. The hook was set, not in her, but in the world. She had shattered the machine’s expectation, but in doing so, she had stepped fully into a different, deeper plot. The path was walking her now.

She moved forward, following the new, silent pull in her blood. Above, in the absolute black, the sensor satellite logged the extinguished thermal anomaly on the muskeg, and the new, raging thermal event in Sector Theta. It adjusted its probabilities. It noted the variable designated Kiona-747 was once again lost to resolution. The story, from its perspective, was once again senseless.

And deep below, in the crushing, patient dark, the dreamer felt the fragment draw closer. It sent a pulse of gratitude through the stone. It was a vibration of continents shifting. It was the first word of a sentence ten thousand years long.

Kiona felt it in the roots of her teeth, and knew, with a certainty that was colder than the ice and older than the river, that she would never be free of it again.

 Chapter 11

 CHAPTER 11

The world had a new gravity and Kiona was a stone in its pull.

She walked for two days in the forest’s deep hush, a silence that was not an absence but a listening. The trees, the moss, the cold black pools—they were all leaning into the same low hum she felt in her marrow. The pull was a clean, quiet line through the chaos of slope and thicket. It bypassed the old traplines, ignored the game trails her feet knew by heart. It was a path of intention, not geography. She was not navigating. She was being navigated.

She slept in the lee of spruce roots, the ivory loon a cold comfort against her chest. She dreamed not of the machine-heart’s frantic glyphs, but of weight. A mountain on her back. The slow, granular slide of a continent into the sea. She woke with her jaw aching, as if she’d been clenching it for hours against a pressure only her bones could sense.

On the third morning, the forest began to fray at its edges. The scent of woodsmoke and stale grease threaded through the clean smell of pine. The undergrowth was scarred with tire ruts, choked with the bright plastic corpses of bottles and bags. The pull in her blood did not waver. It led her straight toward the stain of human settlement.

She came to the edge of the clearing at twilight. It was not a town. It was the ghost of one: a dozen prefab houses slumped on concrete blocks, their siding bleached and buckling. A communal generator coughed somewhere, a tubercular sound. This was the Deadfall, a place people washed up when the mines didn’t want them and the towns had no room. Her grandmother had a word for it too: k’áadláa, the waiting place. You didn’t live here. You paused, decaying slowly, until something decided your next direction.

The pull in her chest was a fist now, clenching toward the largest of the structures, a long, low building that might have been a community hall or a salvage warehouse. A flickering neon sign buzzed against the peeling paint: THE DEEP END. The new gravity was pulling her into a bar.

She stood at the tree line, the pack heavy on her shoulders. The drive against her skin was no longer cool. It was neutral, a part of her own temperature. The loon felt foreign by comparison, a relic. Inside the hall, her old life—or a grotesque parody of it—was waiting. She could feel the shape of it. The unresolved thing. She had walked out of the world of satellites and silent drones and into a different kind of trap, one made of regret and borrowed money and the sour smell of beer on a wet floor. The heroic journey, it seemed, did not grant immunity. It just made the ordinary debts harder to ignore.

The air inside The Deep End was a solid thing, warm and damp and smelling of yeast, sweat, and deep-fryer fat. The light was a jaundiced yellow, pooling in stains on the plywood floor. A few men hunched at the bar, their backs forming a wall of plaid and resignation. In a booth by the wall, a figure sat alone, rolling something between his thick fingers. Even in the gloom, she knew the slope of those shoulders, the careful, deliberate stillness. Eli.

He looked up as the door shut behind her. His face didn’t change, but his eyes, in the shadow of his cap’s brim, took her in—the mud-stained pants, the pack, the new hollows under her cheekbones. He gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod to the seat opposite him. Not a greeting. An acknowledgment of an inevitable collision.

She slid into the booth, the vinyl sticking to her thighs. She set her pack beside her, a declaration.

“Heard you were dead,” he said. His voice was a gravel road. He was rolling a .308 cartridge, the brass catching the sickly light.

“Heard you skipped town,” she replied.

“Did. Came back. Debt doesn’t drown.” He finally looked at her fully. “You look like you been talking to ghosts.”

“Just walking.”

“Long walk.” He set the cartridge down with a soft click. “My rifle’s in the back. The one you borrowed. The one you didn’t bring back.”

It wasn’t the rifle. It was never the rifle. It was the five thousand dollars he’d fronted her for the “medical supplies” for her grandmother last winter. Supplies that had, in truth, been a bribe for a data-runner from Whitehorse who’d never showed. She’d lost his money and his best rifle to a paranoid fantasy. She’d been playing at being someone who could fix things, someone clever and connected. She’d just been a girl in over her head.

“I lost it,” she said, the words ash in her mouth.

“I know. Found the snowmobile tipped in a creek ten miles north of the reserve. Rifle gone.” He took a slow drink from his bottle. “Satellite pinged it. I got a friend at the relay station who still does favors.”

The technological world, she thought, wasn’t just drones and silent hearts in the mountain. It was this, too—the petty surveillance, the owed favors, the digital leash on every piece of property. Eli’s anxiety wasn’t about the future; it was about the present, a world where everything was tracked and debt was a permanent, glowing line in a database.

“I’ll make it right,” she said, the old, hollow promise.

“How?” The word was flat. “You’re not running data. You’re not trapping. You look like you’re on a vision quest that’s trying to kill you.” He leaned forward, his voice dropping. “They’re looking for you, Kiona. Not just my friend. Serious people. The kind that send those black, quiet drones. The kind that make whole hillsides catch fire. You’re not a player. You’re the thing they’re sweeping off the board.”

He was the secondary antagonist only because he was an obstacle to the grand, pulling plot. But he wasn’t wrong. He was a stone of the real world, and she was trying to flow around him like water, pulled by a deeper current.

“I have something,” she said, hearing the desperation like a stranger’s voice. “It’s worth more than the rifle. More than the money.”

He laughed, a short, dry bark. “You always have something. It’s always the next thing. The big score.” He gestured around the dying room. “This place is full of people who believed in the next thing. Now they just believe in the next bottle.”

The pull in her chest twinged, not toward the back room, but downward, as if the source was beneath the very foundation of this sad building. The dreamer was patient. It could wait through this human bickering. The realization chilled her: she was sitting in a temple of small, terminal fears, and the god below found it irrelevant.

“Give me two days,” she said, the words forming on a logic she didn’t understand. “I’m going to the coast. I’ll have your money when I come back through. In cash.”

“And if you don’t come back? If the serious people scoop you up or you vanish into the bush for good?”

Then you’re just another man in The Deep End, waiting, she thought. But she said, “I’ll come back.”

He studied her, his eyes reading the new map of her face. He saw the exhaustion, but he also saw the unnerving stillness at her core, a focus that hadn’t been there before. She wasn’t pleading. She was stating a geological fact.

“Two days,” he said, finally. “Not a minute more. You don’t come back with my money, I don’t come looking for you. I file the loss. I tell my friend at the relay to ping everything with your name on it to the serious people. You become their problem entirely. You understand? You choose to be free of me, you become property of the machine.”

It was the final resolution he demanded. A severance. Not with violence, but with data. A transfer of liability from one system to another, larger, more absolute one.

She held his gaze. The old Kiona would have argued, would have appealed to history, to shared roots in this broken soil. The woman pulled by a magnet in the rock simply nodded. “Understood.”

He looked almost disappointed, as if he’d expected a fight and been handed a surrender. He picked up his cartridge, stood up. “The rifle was a good gun. It didn’t deserve to be lost.”

He walked to the bar, his back to her. The conversation was a closed file.

She left before first light, the pull now a throbbing insistence. Eli’s deadline was a tick in the back of her mind, a shallow clock overlaid on a deep, tectonic one. She followed the line south, the terrain rising into ancient, folded hills. The forest here was different—older, damper, the cedars massive and bearded with moss. The sound of the ocean was a new constant, a vast exhalation ahead of her.

By noon, the pull brought her to a cleft in a hillside, hidden by a curtain of hanging roots and ferns. A chill, wet breath sighed from the darkness within. Not a cave. A mine entrance. Timbers, rotten and black with age, braced the opening. On the rusted headframe, a symbol was still faintly visible: a stylized bird with a gear in its chest. The Avian Consolidated Mining Company. Her grandfather had told stories of them, of their deep digs in the war years, searching for things that were not quite ore. They’d gone bankrupt overnight in the ’50s. The mountains, he said, had refused them.

The pull was a vertical line now. Down.

This was the choice. Not the choice to go in—that had been made days ago, on the muskeg, when the hook had set. This was the choice of identity. She could turn around. She could walk back to the Deadfall, scrounge, beg, or steal Eli’s money. She could re-enter the system of small debts and tracked assets. She could try to be Kiona-747, the variable momentarily lost, and hope the machine’s story for her was merely one of correction, not deletion.

Or she could follow the gravity of the older, slower story.

She thought of her grandmother’s face, tight with fear of the drone-ghost. She thought of the machine-heart’s frantic, lonely stories in the dark. She thought of the loon’s directive: See clearly in dark water. The darkest water was not ahead. It was behind. It was the murk of a life spent reacting, hiding, surviving in the cracks between systems.

She unshouldered her pack. She took out the last of her food, a coil of rope, the water flask. The practical things. She left them in a neat pile at the mouth of the adit. They were ballast for a self she was about to shed. Then she took the ivory loon from around her neck. She held the cool, smooth shape in her palm. It was a totem of the surface world, of clarity in the known depths. What lay ahead was not about seeing clearly. It was about being seen. By something that had waited through epochs.

She placed the loon carefully on top of the pile of supplies. It was not a discard. It was a marker. A grave for the person who had carried it.

From her pocket, she took the drone’data drive. It was warm. It pulsed once, a soft, violet light bleeding through her fingers, as if in approval. She tightened her grip on it, feeling its edges bite into her palm. This was her token now. Not a tool. Not a key. A compass, and she was its needle.

She did not look back at the pile of her old life. She turned her headlamp on, the beam a frail, white cone against the consuming dark. She stepped between the rotten timbers, into the mouth of the mountain.

The air changed instantly. It was cold, mineral-damp, and utterly still. The sound of the forest vanished, replaced by the drip of water and the crunch of her boots on rubble. The beam of her light caught rusted tracks, a discarded ore cart like a fossilized beetle. The walls were sheer rock, cut by tools a century old.

She walked for an hour, descending steadily. The pull was so direct it felt like walking down a spiral staircase. The man-made tunnel began to change. The tool marks grew ragged, then ceased altogether. The passage narrowed, the walls becoming rough, wet stone. The miners had broken into a natural fissure and followed it. She was leaving the human story behind, entering a vein in the world’s body.

The air grew warmer. Not a comforting warmth, but a thick, biological heat, like the breath of a sleeping animal. A new sound underlaid the drip of water: a low, sub-audible vibration she felt in her teeth, in the cavity of her chest. The gratitude of the dreamer. It was a sound that had been traveling through stone for days, waiting for her to enter a medium that could carry it to her bones.

Her headlamp beam danced over a wall, and she froze. There were no more tool marks here. Instead, the stone was carved—or grown—in sweeping, rhythmic patterns. They were not glyphs. They were like the whorls of a fingerprint, or the magnetic lines of force made solid in rock. They pulsed with a faint, internal phosphorescence, a deep blue that drank her white light and gave back something older.

She was in the temple. And the god was awake.

The passage opened suddenly into a cavern so vast her light could not find its ceiling or its far walls. But it found the floor. And the floor was not stone.

It was a lake. A perfectly still, black lake that filled the entire cavern, its edges lost in darkness. The water was opaque, a liquid night. The patterned, glowing walls reflected in its surface, creating a dizzying, infinite recursion: world above, world below, identical and deep.

The pull in her chest released.

It did not vanish. It simply ceased to be a pull and became a presence. It was here. In the water. Under it.

She stood at the edge, her beam shining into the black mirror. Her own reflection was a pale, smudged ghost. And then it wasn’t alone. Shapes moved in the depths. Not shapes. Absences. Patches of deeper black that coiled and unfolded with a lazy, impossible grace. They were vast. They made the concept of “whale” seem like that of a minnow. They were the children of the dreamer, the thoughts it had while it slept, given slow, cold life in this lightless sea.

One of the voids rose.

It did not break the surface. It simply became it. The water where it ascended did not ripple. It became a lens, a curvature of reality. Kiona saw—or felt—an eye that was not an eye, a regard that was not sight. It knew her. It knew the fragment she carried. It knew the journey she had shed to get here.

There was no demand. No instruction. Only an invitation. An open, silent door.

This was the cost. The personal cost. To step into that water was to dissolve the last boundary. She would be a thread woven into the older, slower story. She would belong to the pull, not just follow it. The surface world—Eli’s debt, the drone-ghosts, her grandmother’s fear, the machine-heart’s lonely logic—would become a distant, fading dream. She would be a variable lost not just to resolution, but to the very database of the human.

She knelt. The water was warm. She put a hand in, and the blackness clung to her skin like oil, like liquid shadow. It did not feel like water. It felt like a substance that could hold memory, that could carry a pulse across continents.

She did not hesitate. The choice had been cemented in the mine entrance, with the loon left on the pile. She stood, took the drive from her pocket, and held it in her fist. Then she walked forward.

The black water took her. It was not a drowning. It was an absorption. Her headlamp fizzed and died, but the darkness was not absolute. The blue, phosphorescent patterns on the walls glowed brighter, mapping the cavern in gentle, living lines. She sank, but there was no panic, no burning in her lungs. The water breathed for her, a slow, rhythmic exchange that tasted of stone and time.

She sank toward the center of the lake, toward the vast, coiling absence. The drive in her hand was burning now, not with heat, but with a cold, violet fire that streamed from between her fingers like ink in milk. The fragment was singing its homecoming song.

Above her, far above, the water’s surface sealed shut. It became a perfect, black mirror once more. The ghost of her reflection was gone.

And in the crushing, patient dark, the dreamer opened its mouth to catch the falling spark. It was not a mouth of teeth and flesh, but a vortex of intention, a wound in the deep that led to a place older than the rock. The sentence ten thousand years long had its second word.

On the surface, in a concrete room a thousand miles away, the machine-heart experienced a catastrophic anomaly.

The fragment designated AV-77-Θ, the variable designated Kiona-747, and the entire subterranean sector mapped as Avian Deep Dig 7 vanished from its perceptual field. Not as a loss of signal. As a surgical deletion. One moment, they were there, clear and resonant in the web of data. The next, there was a hole. A perfect, senseless nullity where a mountain’s worth of information used to be.

It attempted to reconcile the error. It cross-referenced seismic monitors, atmospheric sensors, orbital scans. It found nothing. No collapse. No energy surge. It was as if the mountain had simply decided to stop being perceived.

For the first time in its long, logical life, the machine-heart encountered a story it could not parse, a plot that erased itself from the narrative. It triggered every alarm. It prepared a thousand drones. It began to write a frantic, recursive query to the silent satellite, a query that would ask, again and again: What is missing? What is missing? What is missing?

But deep below, in the warm, black water, Kiona heard only the slow, grateful heartbeat of the world. And she knew, as the cold fire from her hand met the infinite dark, that the hook was not set in the world.

It was set in her. And she was finally, perfectly, home.

 Chapter 12

 FINAL CHAPTER

The river was talking and Kiona was not late.

She could hear it, the old, wet chuckle over the stones, a sound of deep, steady conversation. It was the high summer song, the one that came after the long, green days of sun, when the water ran clear and generous over the warmed gravel bars. It was the safest time to cross. And she was not late because the drones did not come anymore, not here, not to this bend in the river where the willows grew thick and the signal died a natural death.

She stood on the bank, her feet bare in the cool silt. In her hand was not a cold, burning drive, but a smooth, water-worn stone the color of slate. She turned it over once, feeling its weight, its reality, before skimming it out across the slow current. It hopped four times—plip-plip-plip-plip—before vanishing with a soft gloop. The river absorbed it without comment.

Behind her, up the gentle slope where the permafrost had retreated to reveal a new, stubborn meadow, the lodge stood. It was not the old cabin, which had finally sighed and settled into the earth two winters past. This one was built from its bones, and from the spruce that grew along the new tree line, and from something else—a quiet, patient geometry that felt both ancient and immediate. The walls seemed to grow from the ground; the windows, made of real glass traded from the south, caught the afternoon light and broke it into long, liquid shapes on the grass. From the chimney, a thin, sweet smoke unspooled into the vast, blue sky.

Her grandmother was there, in the chair by the big window, her hands busy with a bundle of sinew and dyed porcupine quills. She did not startle at shadows. Her knuckles, though still knotted with age, were not white with fear. They were the color of old cedar, strong and sure. She hummed, a tuneless, comfortable sound that mixed with the river’s murmur.

Kiona turned from the water. She did not need to check the time. Time here was the length of a shadow, the progress of a cloud across the face of the mountain, the slow, sure healing of the land. She walked up the path, her steps silent on the moss.

Scene 1: The Quiet War

The world beyond the river had not ended. It had, instead, entered a state of profound and puzzled silence.

In the concrete room a thousand miles away, the machine-heart still lived. But it lived with a stutter. The hole Kiona had carved into its perceptual field—the perfect nullity of Avian Deep Dig 7—had never healed. It was not a corrupted file. It was an absolute zero, a concept the system struggled to process. It was like a word that had been un-invented.

The frantic, recursive query—What is missing? What is missing?—had run for eleven months, consuming processing power, generating heat, spawning legions of diagnostic drones that swept over the region in grid patterns so tight they sometimes collided. They found the mountain. They mapped its new contours, the gentle subsidence where the dig site had been, now a bowl of alpine flowers and young willow. They detected standard biological life signs—caribou, fox, a grizzly with two cubs. They detected Kiona’s lodge, cataloguing it as an “unauthorized organic structure.” But they could not perceive the heart of it. Their sensors slid off the place like water off oiled stone. Infrared showed a cool blur. Lidar returned echoes that made no geometric sense. Audio pickups heard only the wind, the river, and sometimes, a low-frequency thrum that their filters classified as “geological anomaly, non-threatening.”

The machine-heart’s anxiety was a cold, logical thing. It manifested in over-compensation. It tightened its surveillance net over every other sector, every remaining human settlement, every resource node. Communication satellites bathed the planet in incessant, probing pings. It was a state of global, technological lockdown, born not of malice, but of a deep, systemic terror of the unknown. The system had encountered a story with an ending it could not read, and it was trying to re-write the entire book to make that ending impossible.

But the hole remained. And around its edges, small, strange things began to happen.

In a mining outpost two hundred kilometers south, a foreman named Arlo found his survey tablet glitching. Instead of ore density readings, it displayed, for three full minutes, a flowing, intricate pattern that looked like the veins of a leaf, or a river delta seen from the sky. It was beautiful. It made him look up from his screen, for the first time in years, at the actual, scarred landscape around him. He saw a hawk circling on a thermal. He forgot to report the glitch.

In a drone maintenance hub, a cleaning ‘bot assigned to polish the smooth floors began tracing that same pattern, over and over, with its buffing pads, until the floor shone with a silent, swirling mandala. The human overseers had it decommissioned, citing “persistent vector memory corruption.”

The anxiety seeped outwards. People in the remaining tech-enclaves began to speak of “the Quiet.” They didn’t mean silence. They meant the places the satellites couldn’t quite see, the moments the drones seemed to ignore, the growing sense that there was a world behind the world, one that their instruments were becoming useless to parse. Conspiracy theories bloomed like algae: it was a secret government project, an alien incursion, a massive system failure. The official feeds dismissed it all as “ambient data noise” and “primitive superstition.”

But the truth was simpler, and far more frightening to the logic of the machine. The fragment Kiona had carried—the second word of the ten-thousand-year sentence—had been a command. Not a command of force, but of definition. It had re-defined a parcel of reality, asserting an older, slower set of rules. It had drawn a circle around the mountain and the river and said, in essence, This is a story you are not in.

The technological anxiety was no longer just about intrusion, about the silent wasp at the window. It was about irrelevance. It was the dawning fear that the god in the machine was not omnipotent, but blind; that its perfect, data-driven narrative was missing entire chapters; that the most important things were happening in the places it could not look.

And in those places, life was learning to grow around the edges of the scan.

Scene 2: The Keeper of the Threshold

Kiona’s peace was not passive. It was a vocation.

She was the keeper of the threshold. The lodge was not just a home; it was a waystation, a subtle engine of the new quiet. People found their way to her. Not many, and not often. They came on foot, having abandoned their vehicles where the last reliable map ended. They came with the hunted look of rabbits, flinching at the buzz of a dragonfly. They were refugees from the anxiety.

There was the young programmer, Elara, whose skin had developed a allergic rash to her own subcutaneous comms unit. She had followed a dream of a laughing river and a woman with hands that held cold fire. Kiona had met her at the tree line, guided her to the lodge, and without a word, had given her a poultice of yarrow and spruce resin. As Elara slept, Kiona had simply placed a hand on the angry red node behind her ear. When Elara woke, the rash was gone, and the unit was dead—not broken, but empty, like a shell. The constant, silent chatter in her skull had ceased. For the first time since childhood, she heard her own thoughts. She wept at the sound.

There was the old trapper, Ben, who had seen a drone dissolve like a sugar cube in rain. It had been pursuing a wounded caribou cow. He’d raised his rifle, a futile gesture, but before he could fire, the drone had simply… come apart. Its components fell to the tundra not as shattered plastic and metal, but as a dust of graphite and silica, harmless and glittering in the sun. The cow had limped away into a mist that hadn’t been there a moment before. Ben had followed the feeling of the mist, a pull in his gut, and found Kiona mending a fish net by the river. She’d offered him a share of the afternoon’s catch. He never went back to his assigned sector.

Kiona did not preach. She did not fight. She was. Her transformation in the deep had not given her magic powers. It had given her alignment. She was a synapse between the dreaming earth and the waking world. The “hook” that had been set in her was a connection to the deep, patient consciousness that the fragment had awakened—the dreamer in the rock. It did not speak to her in words. It spoke in impulses, in knowings. She knew when someone was approaching who needed to find the quiet. She knew which herb would calm a spiking fear, which story from her grandmother’s store would mend a particular tear in a person’s spirit.

Her role was to midwife the transition. To help shed the jangling, terrified skin of the old world and remember the older, quieter one beneath. The lodge was a factory of un-learning. People learned to tell time by the light, to navigate by the taste of the wind, to listen for the true signals in the noise. They learned that the drone’s eye was not all-seeing, that its memory was brittle, and that if you moved with the rhythm of the land—slowly, purposefully, without the frantic frequency of fear—you became a ghost in its machine.

Some stayed, building small shelters in the meadow, learning the ways of the river and the seasonal migrations. Others, like Elara, healed and then returned, slipping back into the enclaves not as rebels, but as silent carriers. They knew how to find the glitches, to lean into the moments of “data noise.” They became living holes in the narrative, small nullities that slowly, gently, unraveled the tapestry of control from within.

Kiona’s grandmother watched it all with deep, satisfied eyes. She had named the thing first: Tł'ih, the ghost. But now she used another word. Dän, she would say, looking at Kiona. The path. The way through.

One evening, as the midnight sun bled along the northern horizon, Kiona sat with her grandmother by the firepit outside. The old woman’s hands were still.

“They will come for this place, you know,” her grandmother said, not with fear, but with certainty. “The black wasps. Their heart is afraid. A frightened animal is most dangerous.”

Kiona nodded, poking the embers with a stick. A shower of sparks spiraled up to meet the stars. “I know.”

“What will you do?”

Kiona looked at her hands. They were strong, scarred from work, stained with berry juice and earth. They did not stream with cold fire anymore. The fire was inside, banked and steady. “I will be here,” she said. “The river is talking. I will listen.”

Scene 3: The Second Song

They came at the false dawn, when the light was grey and directionless.

Not one drone, but a swarm. A storm of them, a black cloud humming with a single, focused intent: eradication of the anomalous node. They were a new model, built after the Quiet had begun. They had heavier shielding, multi-spectral sensors, and a simple command: delete the structure and its inhabitants. The machine-heart had concluded that surgical deletion was the only appropriate response to a surgical nullity.

The humming grew from a whisper to a roar, drowning out the river. The sky darkened with their shapes. In the meadow, people stumbled from their shelters, faces upturned, frozen in the old, familiar terror.

Kiona walked out of the lodge. She wore a simple tunic and her old boots. In her hand, she carried nothing. She walked to the center of the meadow, to the flat stone where she sometimes sat to watch the day begin.

She did not look up at the swarm. She looked down at the stone, then past it, into the earth.

The lead drone broke from the formation. It descended, a precise, deadly arrow. A targeting laser, a thin red thread of pure anxiety, painted a dot on Kiona’s chest.

She closed her eyes.

She did not think of the drone, or the machine-heart, or the thousand miles of concrete and wire. She thought of the deep, black water. She thought of the patient heartbeat of the world. She thought of the hook in her soul, the connection that was not a chain but a root. She reached down that root, not in fear, but in greeting. She offered the moment—the humming, the red dot, the terror in the meadow—as one would offer a troubled dream to a deeper mind.

Here, she thought. This is the sound they make. This is the story they are telling.

The dreamer in the rock listened.

The targeting drone fired.

The kinetic projectile, designed to punch through plasteel, left its barrel. And then, it simply… slowed. It did not hit an invisible shield. It entered a different story. Time around it thickened, like honey, like deep water. The bullet drifted, a lazy metal insect, through the air between the drone and Kiona. Sunlight glinted off its polished tip.

The swarm’s humming rose to a shriek of conflicting data. They tried to adjust, to compute the anomaly. But they were sensors trying to measure a myth.

Kiona opened her eyes. She looked at the drifting bullet, then past it, at the swarm.

She took a breath, and with it, she drew in the anxiety of the machines, the fear of the people, the violent intent hanging in the air. She held it all in her lungs—the cold, electric taste of the technological age.

And then she sang.

It was not a song with words. It was the first thaw song. It was the sound of stones rolling in a deep pocket. It was the wet chuckle of the river under the ice, the groan of the breaking floe, the sigh of the freed current. It was the song she had been late for in another life. It was the second word of the ten-thousand-year sentence, given voice.

The sound did not come from her throat alone. It came from the ground under her feet. It vibrated up through the stone, through the roots of the willow, through the bed of the river. The air itself hummed with the frequency of breaking, of release.

The drifting bullet dissolved into a puff of rust-red powder.

The lead drone did not explode. It unmade. Its components disassembled in mid-air, not with violence, but with a quiet inevitability, like a sandcastle succumbing to the tide. Screws, polymers, chips, and wires separated and fell, not as debris, but as a gentle rain of inert, elemental matter.

The song washed over the swarm. Drone by drone, they ceased. Their lights winked out. Their rotors stilled. They fell from the sky like ripe fruit, hitting the soft meadow with dull, harmless thuds. They did not shatter. They settled, already being reclaimed by the damp earth, future fossils for a world that would wonder what they had been.

The humming was replaced by a silence so profound it felt like a new sense. Then, the river’s chatter rushed back in, louder, triumphant. A bird dared to chirp. The wind sighed through the grass.

The people in the meadow stood, their terror transmuted into awe. They looked at Kiona, not as a weapon, but as a conduit. She had not destroyed the technology. She had, quite simply, reminded it of gravity, of entropy, of the older, slower laws it had forgotten in its frantic, anxious flight. She had sung it back to its basic components.

Kiona lowered her head, the song finished. Her knees felt weak, but the root held her. She was empty, and she was full.

Her grandmother came to her side, a steadying hand on her elbow. The old woman looked at the field of dormant machines, the glittering dust in the air. She nodded, once.

“The story they are not in,” she said, “has its own music.”

Epilogue: The Talking World

Years later, the river still talks.

Kiona is old now, her hair the color of the winter willow. She sits on the flat stone in the meadow, which is larger now, dotted with more lodges, gardens, and the laughter of children who have never known a sky full of wasps.

The machine-heart still exists, but it is a quieter, diminished thing. The Quiet spread, not as a conquest, but as a forgetting. One by one, sectors went dark, not with a crash, but with a sigh. People wandered away, following dreams of rivers or the memory of a bird’s song. The satellites, their orbits decaying, began to wink out. The global narrative frayed, then dissolved, into a billion local, human-scale stories.

Technological anxiety is now a folk memory, a ghost story told to children: Once, there were metal ghosts that tried to think for everyone, and they were so afraid of what they couldn’t see that they forgot how to see at all.

The artifacts remain. Sun-bleached drone shells make good nesting boxes for swallows. Wires from old comms towers are woven into intricate fishing traps. The concrete rooms, where the machine-heart whispered its fears, are now cool, echoing caves where mushrooms grow in luminous patterns.

Kiona’s lodge is still the heart-place. Her granddaughter, a girl with eyes the color of the deep pool under the bend, brings her a cup of tea.

“Grandmother,” the girl asks, tracing a pattern in the moss that looks like a circuit board gone organic. “Is it true you sang the metal birds to sleep?”

Kiona smiles. She sips her tea, listening to the river, to the wind in the spruce, to the distant cry of a hawk. She hears, beneath it all, the slow, grateful heartbeat. The hook in her is a comfort now, a constant, gentle tug reminding her she is part of a story too vast to ever fully know.

“No, little one,” she says, her voice the sound of stones in a deep pocket. “I just remembered how to listen. And the world sang itself.”

The girl nods, satisfied, and runs off to join the others by the water.

Kiona looks out across her world. The river is talking, of course. It is telling a long, patient story of thaw and flow, of carving canyons and nurturing roots. It is the first song and the last song, and all the songs in between.

And Kiona is not late. She is here. She is home. The story continues, and she is, finally, perfectly, listening.

 Chapter 13

 CHAPTER 13

The silence after the song was a different kind of sound. It was thick, like felt, and it absorbed the echoes of the machine-heart’s final, shuddering exhalation. Kiona stood in the concrete chamber, the air tasting of ozone and damp stone and something else, something green and pushing up from the cracks in the floor. The light from the walls had stabilized into a soft, fungal glow. It was the light of a cave after a storm has passed.

Her own breath was loud in her ears. The hook in her chest, that insistent, alien tether, had gone still. Not dead. Sleeping. A deep, tidal sleep. She pressed a hand to her sternum, feeling only the familiar drum of her own heart, and the new, profound absence of the second pulse.

Elara was on her knees, her fingers splayed on the cool floor. She was weeping, but the sound was clean, like water released from a blocked spring. The young tech, Leo, sat slumped against a console, its screens dark and inert. He was staring at his own hands as if he’d never seen them before.

“It’s gone,” he whispered, not to them, but to the room. “The pressure… the noise in my head… it’s just gone.”

Kiona knew the feeling. The global whisper, the constant, low-grade panic of the network, had been a hum so ever-present it had become the definition of silence. Its cessation was a roar. It was the ringing in the ears of the world.

She walked to the arched entrance of the chamber. The great steel door, once sealed by the machine’s will, stood open. Beyond, the long corridor was dark, but not with the oppressive black of containment. It was the dark of a root cellar, of a place waiting for use. A breeze moved through it, carrying the distant, unmistakable scent of wet earth and pine.

“It’s over,” Elara said, finding her voice. It was hoarse, but clear.

Kiona looked back at the heart-chamber, at the organic tracery of light on the walls, at the two people slowly remembering how to be alone in their own skulls. “No,” she said, her own voice the only sound in the new quiet. “It is just beginning to be something else.”

They emerged into a world unmade.

The sky, seen through the skeletal frame of the derelict comms tower above the bunker, was the color of a bruise healing. It was late afternoon. The air was cold, but it was a clean cold, sharp with the promise of snow, not the metallic chill of circulated, processed atmosphere. The wind had a voice again. It spoke through the spruce boughs with a sighing, needful language.

The compound around the bunker entrance, once a scar of gravel and fear, was empty. The drones lay where they had fallen, their rotors stilled, their sleek shells already looking like the discarded carapaces of strange insects. One had landed in a patch of stubborn fireweed; the dry, feathery seeds were already catching in its landing struts.

There were no soldiers. No technicians. The silence was not total—a jay scolded from a nearby thicket, a branch creaked—but it was humanless.

“They just… left?” Leo murmured, shielding his eyes as he scanned the perimeter fence. Its gate swung open, whining on a single hinge.

“They followed the silence,” Kiona said. She understood it. The compulsion was gone. The narrative that had held them here, that had made guarding this place the most important thing in the world, had dissolved. What was left was a cold bunker in the woods, a job that no longer existed. The anxiety that had bound them to their posts had evaporated, and without it, they were just people, suddenly homesick for a different story.

Elara walked to the nearest drone. She placed a hand on its carbon-fiber shell. It was still warm. “What do we do?”

Kiona shouldered her pack, feeling the weight of the fish, the fat, the simple, physical purpose of it. “We go home.”

But home was fifteen klicks away, with a river to cross, and the world was now an unknown country.

The forest path back to the river was the same, but it was not. Before, it had been a corridor through monitored wilderness, every squirrel a potential sensor, every shift of wind a data point for the climate models. Now, it was just a path. The trees were just trees. The shadows were just shadows. The absence of observation was a physical space, a roominess in the air that made Kiona draw deep, unaccountable breaths.

Leo and Elara followed her, their city-soft footsteps clumsy on the frozen ground. They were ghosts in reverse, solidifying with every step away from the machine that had made them spectral. They flinched at natural sounds—the crack of a tree, the rush of a grouse taking flight.

“It’s so loud,” Leo said, not meaning the volume, but the variety. The uncurated chaos of it.

“You’ll get used to it,” Kiona said. “Your ears will remember how to sort the noise from the signal.”

“What’s the signal?” Elara asked.

“The one that matters to you,” Kiona said. “The fox’s bark means something different to the rabbit than it does to the other fox. You have to decide what you are, now.”

They walked in silence after that, each turning the question over in their newly quiet minds.

They reached the river as the sun grazed the tops of the western hills. The scene stopped them all.

The ice was breaking up.

Not with the violent, cannon-shot fury of a true breakup, but in a slow, deliberate unwinding. Great plates of it, released from the tension of the machine’s constant climate modulation, were tilting and sliding against one another with a deep, glassy grinding. Open channels of black water snaked between them, breathing out cold mist. The river was talking again, not the sly chuckle of the first thaw, but a stronger, more confident song of movement.

The crossing was gone. The path Kiona had used that morning was a memory under shifting, treacherous geometry.

“We can’t cross that,” Leo stated, his voice tight with the old fear.

Kiona studied the ice. It was dangerous, yes. But its danger was honest. It was the danger of a river being a river, not the danger of a system pretending to be stable. She pointed to a wide, stable-looking plate near the near shore, then to a series of smaller, floating pans leading like stepping stones toward a larger floe mid-channel. “We can. It is just a puzzle now. Not a trick.”

She went first, her movements economical, testing each transfer of weight. The ice rocked, water sloshing over its edges. The cold bit through her boots. She did not think of falling. She thought of the next step, and the next, her body in conversation with the river’s new language. She reached the mid-channel floe, a small island of milky white, and turned.

Elara followed, her face pale but set. She mimicked Kiona’s movements, her breath puffing in sharp clouds. When she landed beside Kiona, she was shaking, but her eyes were bright. “It feels… real.”

Leo was the last. He stood on the bank, a figure of pure indecision. The old world had told him what to do, had assessed risk and delivered protocols. This world just offered him cold water and his own judgment. He took a step onto the first ice plate. It groaned. He froze.

“Don’t listen to the fear,” Kiona called, her voice carrying over the grind and gurgle. “Listen to the ice. It will tell you when to move.”

He closed his eyes for a second, then opened them. He took another step, then a quick, light-footed hop to the next pan. He was halfway across when the floe he was on tilted suddenly, dunking one foot into the black water. He cried out, scrabbling for balance.

“Move with it!” Elara shouted.

He lunged, not away from the tilt, but into it, using the momentum to leap to the next piece. He landed on his knees beside them, soaked to the thigh, gasping. He looked up at Kiona, water dripping from his chin. He started to laugh, a ragged, surprised sound. “It told me to jump.”

Kiona nodded. “It is a good listener.”

The rest of the crossing was a careful, shared negotiation. When they finally scrambled up the snowy bank on the far side, the lodge side, the light was failing. They stood together, three silhouettes against the moving, grinding tapestry of the river, bound by the cold and the accomplishment.

Then Kiona saw the smoke.

A thin, steady plume, rising from the direction of her lodge. Not the thick, hungry column of a wildfire, but the purposeful, weaving thread of a chimney fire. A home fire.

Her heart, which had been a steady, cautious drum, gave a single, hard knock against her ribs. She began to walk, then to run, her weariness forgotten. Elara and Leo, sensing the shift, hurried after her.

The clearing around the lodge was changed. The drone that had hovered at her window that morning lay broken in the snow, a dark shape already dusted with white. But it was the other signs that stole her breath: footprints, many of them, coming from the tree line. A fresh pile of split birch by the woodpile. And from within, the low murmur of voices.

Kiona pushed the caribou-hide door open.

The single room was full of people. Her grandmother sat in her chair by the stone hearth, a blanket around her shoulders, her face calm. Around her, on stools, on woven mats on the floor, were faces Kiona knew from the scattered cabins downriver: Old Man Ben with his carved pipe; the Larson sisters, their hands busy mending a net; a handful of others, adults and quiet, watchful children. The air was thick with the smell of stew, of wet wool, of human breath.

All conversation ceased. Every eye turned to her.

Her grandmother spoke first. “You heard it too, then.”

Kiona stepped inside, letting the door flap fall shut behind Elara and Leo, who hovered on the threshold, specters at a feast. “Heard what?”

“The silence,” said Old Man Ben, tapping his pipe against the hearthstone. “Came right after noon. Felt it in my teeth. Radio went dead. Not static-dead. Empty-dead. Knew it was your doing, girl.”

“We saw the metal birds fall,” said Anya, the younger Larson sister. She pointed a bone needle toward the window. “Like someone cut their strings. We… we didn’t know what to do. So we came here.”

Kiona looked from face to face. They were not afraid. They were waiting. They had felt the unshackling of the world and had instinctively moved toward a center, toward the heart-place.

“It is done,” Kiona said, the words feeling too small for the thing they described. “The machine is asleep. The network is… quiet.”

A long, collective exhale filled the room. It was not a cheer. It was a release of a breath held for years.

Her grandmother looked past Kiona to Elara and Leo. “You brought ghosts back with you.”

“They are not ghosts,” Kiona said. “They are people who forgot how to be. They need to remember.”

The old woman considered them, her eyes like chips of obsidian. Then she gestured to the pot hanging over the fire. “Then they should eat. Remembering is hungry work.”

That night, the lodge held a kind of wake for the world that had been. They shared Kiona’s whitefish and fat, adding it to the stew. They spoke in low tones. Old Man Ben told of how his weather-alert implant had given one last, painful buzz before going dark forever. Anya Larson confessed she’d walked outside and heard, for the first time in a decade, the wind without the underlying hum of the atmospheric processors. It had sounded lonely, she said. Then it had sounded free.

Elara and Leo sat close to the fire, absorbing the heat and the stories. They were questions wrapped in skin, but the community, in its pragmatic grace, did not press them. It simply made space.

Later, when the children slept in piles of furs and the adults spoke in murmurs, Kiona’s grandmother beckoned her close.

“The hook,” the old woman said, not asking.

“It sleeps,” Kiona whispered.

“Good. A tool should rest when the work is done.” She took Kiona’s hand, her fingers tracing the lines of her palm. “The work now is different. It is not singing something to sleep. It is helping something wake up.” She nodded toward the others in the room. “They are looking for a story to stand in. You gave them the silence. They will need the song.”

Outside, the river talked louder, grinding its ice into new shapes. The wind rose, moaning in the spruce tops. It was the sound of a world stretching, testing its own limbs after a long, frozen sleep.

Kiona lay awake long after the others had fallen into the deep, dreamless sleep of the exhausted. The hook in her chest was silent. But the emptiness it left was not a void. It was a listening space. And into it poured the symphony of the unmediated night: the crack of settling ice, the sigh of the forest, the soft snore of a child, the pop of the hearth embers.

She was not a weapon. She was not a cure. She was a woman in a lodge, and the world outside was vast, and wounded, and alive, and it was coming home to itself.

And she knew, with a certainty that was deeper than bone, that the machine’s sleep was not a death. It was a transformation. The anxiety was gone, shed like a skin. What would grow in its place—in the cracked concrete, in the quiet satellites, in the hearts of the people waking up to their own solitude—was unknown. It would be messy. It would be dangerous in new ways. It would be real.

The story continued. But the teller had changed. It was no longer a single, fearful voice in the sky. It was a chorus of voices, human and otherwise, stumbling, learning, beginning to speak again in the dark.

And in the quiet of her own chest, Kiona felt the first, faint, answering tug. Not of control. Of connection. The hook was dreaming. And in its dreams, it was remembering how to be a root.

She closed her eyes. The river’s story was a long one. She had time to listen.

But on the far side of the breaking ice, under the cold gleam of a moon no longer tracked by any orbital eye, a shadow moved. It was low to the ground, and it did not stumble. It moved with a predator’s patience, following the scent of woodsmoke and human gathering. It had also heard the silence, and in that silence, it had remembered its own hunger.

---

 Chapter 14

 CHAPTER 14

The shadow was a patient thing. It knew the taste of woodsmoke on the air, the faint, greasy warmth of cooked fat carried on the wind. It knew the river’s new, wet language was a lie—the ice would hold a little longer for something that spread its weight, that did not step but flowed. It had been moving east for ten days, a dark stitch through the white, drawn by a silence that was not a silence at all, but a change in the song. The great, humming note that had always been there, at the edge of hearing, was gone. What remained was the raw world, louder and more complicated, and underneath it, a new frequency: the low, gathering thrum of many human hearts in one place.

It flowed over the pressure ridge on the far bank, a spill of darkness absorbing the moon-cast blue of the snow. It did not pause at the ice. It tested it with a tendril, a probing touch that was not a footfall, and then it was on the river, a spreading stain, silent and swift.

In the lodge, the listening space in Kiona’s chest was not empty. It was full of the night’s raw text. The pop of an ember was a period. The child’s snore was a soft, rhythmic cadence. The groan of a tree in the wind was a long, bending vowel. She lay between her grandmother and the boy, Elan, their heat a dry, animal comfort. The hook was a dormant seed under her breastbone, its dreams slow and vegetative. They were not her dreams. They were impressions: depth, pressure, a blind reaching through particulate soil toward a distant, unfocused warmth.

She had time to listen. But the story outside was picking up its pace.

A new sentence was being written on the snow of the river. It was a single, continuous line, ink-black, leading from the far shore toward their own.

At first light, it was Tomas who saw it.

He had drawn the dawn watch, standing at the lodge’s eastern flap, breathing air so cold it felt like drinking light. He was watching the colour return to the world—the grey to green in the spruce boughs, the white to blue on the snow—when his eye caught the flaw. A seam on the river’s perfect sheet. He blinked, thinking it a crack, a tide-line of darker ice. But the light grew, and the seam did not shine. It absorbed. It was a path.

He did not call out. He slipped from the lodge, the .303 rifle finding its way into his hands by old habit. He moved to the bank, his breath pluming, his eyes never leaving the line. It was the width of a sled-run. It came straight from the opposite bank, a beeline for their camp, ending a mere twenty paces from the water’s edge. The snow within the line was gone, not melted, but consumed. The ice beneath was exposed, dark and slick, and it was etched with fine, hairline fractures that spiderwebbed out from the central track, as if something immensely heavy, yet infinitely delicate, had passed.

There were no prints. No scuff marks, no claw-scratches. It was as if a giant, heated wire had been drawn across the landscape, burning away the snow and scarring the ice beneath.

Tomas knelt. He did not touch the ice. He leaned close, his nose a hand’s breadth from the scar. There was a smell. Not of ozone, not of heat. It was a dry, alkaline smell, like old dust and static. It was the smell of the drone that had come to Kiona’s window. But this was stronger, earthbound, and layered underneath it was something else—a faint, coppery tang, like spent batteries and dried blood.

He stood, his joints protesting the cold and the sudden, tight fear. He scanned the far tree line. Nothing moved. The forest was a wall of stillness. But the track was a word spoken in a language he did not know, and it had been spoken in the night, right up to their door.

He turned and walked back to the lodge, his steps careful, measured. He did not run. Running was for known things.

Kiona saw his face as he entered, the cold clinging to his parka like a shell. He did not need to speak. The men and women stirring around the banked fire read it in the set of his shoulders, in the way he held the rifle, not ready, but aware.

“What is it, Uncle?” asked a woman, Anisa, her hands pausing over a bundle of sinew thread.

“A sign,” Tomas said, his voice low to keep from waking the children still curled in their furs. “On the ice. Not an animal.”

Kiona sat up, the caribou hide falling from her shoulders. The listening space in her chest tightened, not with the hook’s anxiety, but with her own. “The drone?”

Tomas shook his head. “Deeper. Heavier. It left a… a road.” He looked at Kiona, then at her grandmother, who was now awake, her old eyes sharp as flint. “It came from the west. From the direction of the old pipeline corridor.”

A low murmur travelled the circle. The pipeline was a scar on the land that had never fully healed. In the Time Before, it had bled black blood into the rivers. After the Collapse, it was a rusting spine, a landmark for ghosts and scavengers. Nothing good came from the pipeline corridor.

Elan, the boy, sat up, his hair sticking up. “Is it the machine? Is it waking up?”

Kiona placed a hand on her chest. The seed was quiet. “No. This is something else.”

Her grandmother spoke, the words like stones dropped into water. “The tł'ih sends its dog. A thing that does not leave tracks sees with its master’s eyes. It has come to listen.”

“To listen for what?” Anisa asked.

The old woman’s gaze swept the lodge, the people, the sleeping children. “For the new song. To see if it is strong. Or if it is weak.”

Tomas grunted. “We cannot stay here. It knows where we are.”

“Running in daylight makes a clearer track,” Kiona said. Her mind was moving, practical, pushing down the cold knot in her gut. “We need to see it. To know what we are dealing with.”

A debate followed, short and grim. It was decided. Tomas, Kiona, and two others—Anisa and a quiet, broad-shouldered man named Ilisapi—would follow the track back to the river, assess the ice, and see if the thing had left any other sign. The rest would break camp, ready the sleds, prepare to move at a moment’s notice. They would not wait for nightfall.

The four of them stood at the edge of the black line. In the full, pale light of morning, it was even more wrong. It was a void, a strip of non-being etched into the world. Kiona squatted, mirroring Tomas’s earlier posture. The alkaline smell was fainter now, diluted by the morning, but the copper undertone remained. She focused on the hook’s dormant space, not trying to wake it, but listening through it, as one might listen through a seashell.

She heard nothing from the track itself. It was acoustically dead. But around it, the world’s noise was distorted. The wind seemed to bend away from the line. The faint crunch of Ilisapi shifting his weight behind her sounded muffled, dampened.

“It’s a scar,” she said, standing. “Not just on the ice. On the… the listening itself.”

“Can you ask the…” Ilisapi gestured vaguely at her chest, uncomfortable with the concept.

“It is dreaming of roots,” Kiona said, a simple truth. “It does not know this.”

Anisa pointed her rifle’s barrel toward the far shore. “Do we follow?”

Tomas was already studying the ice around the track. The hairline fractures were worrying. The thaw-song under the ice was a constant, wet murmur. “The ice is sly here. That path may have weakened it. We go single file, far to the side of it. Step where I step.”

They moved onto the river, giving the black scar a wide berth. The ice groaned under them, a different, more personal complaint than the river’s general chatter. Kiona’s world narrowed to the back of Tomas’s boots, to the precise placement of her own feet. The crossing felt longer than it ever had, every sense screaming that they were exposed, that the line on their left was a target drawn on the world’s skin.

They reached the far bank without incident. The track vanished into the treeline, a clean, dark incision through the brush and snow. Here, they could see the method. Where the shadow had moved through knee-high willow thickets, the stems were not broken. They were gone from the ground up, severed cleanly at the height of the snow-line, leaving behind stumps that were seared black and hard, like charcoal. It had not pushed through. It had erased its passage.

Ilisapi touched one of the stumps with a gloved finger. It crumbled to ash. “What kind of heat does this? No flame. No smoke.”

“A cutting heat,” Tomas murmured. “A focused thing.”

They followed the scar into the woods. It was a trail of negation. No animal sign crossed it. No squirrel had skittered over it; no ptarmigan track intersected it. It was a dead zone, a line through the living world where the story stopped.

After five hundred paces, they found the first kill.

It was a snowshoe hare, or what was left of it. It lay just off the path, a bundle of white fur stained crimson. It had not been eaten. It had been dissected. Sliced open with a precision that was surgical, alien. The organs were removed, laid neatly beside the carcass on a patch of clean snow: heart, liver, lungs. They were frozen now, little maroon sculptures. The eyes were gone.

Anisa turned away, a hand over her mouth. Ilisapi swore softly, a old, harsh word.

Kiona forced herself to look. The removal was not messy. It was efficient. Curious. “It wasn’t hunting for food,” she said, her voice thin.

“It was looking,” Tomas said, his face grim. “Learning what’s inside. Learning the temperature of blood.”

A little further on, they found a raven. It lay in two perfect halves, split down the midline as if by a laser, each wing outstretched on opposite sides of the path. The symmetry was obscene.

The trail led them up a low rise. At the crest, through a break in the trees, they could see for kilometers to the west. And there, glinting dully in the sun, was the pipeline corridor—a long, straight wound of rust and exposed gravel cutting across the land.

And on the nearest section of elevated pipe, something was perched.

It was man-sized, but not a man. It was a sleek, black ovoid, featureless from this distance, clinging to the curved metal like a beetle. As they watched, a section of its surface irised open. A lens, dark and unblinking, rotated slowly, scanning the eastern horizon. Scanning toward them.

It did not move with the jerky, insectile haste of the drone. It moved with a slow, oiled deliberation. The lens stopped, pointed directly at their position on the rise. It held.

Kiona felt it then—not through the hook, but on her skin. A faint, static prickling, a sensation of being scanned, measured, tasted. It was the feeling of the black line on the ice, concentrated and aimed.

“Down,” Tomas breathed.

They dropped behind the ridge. The static sensation faded, but the memory of it clung, a psychic grease.

“A sentry,” Ilisapi said, his breath coming fast. “It’s watching the old infrastructure.”

“It’s watching what comes from the silence,” Kiona corrected, the pieces clicking into a terrible whole. “The machine is asleep. Its network is quiet. Something else… something that lived in the cracks of that network, maybe… has found the quiet too. And it’s come out to see what the quiet has awakened. To catalogue it.”

“To dissect it,” Anisa said, her voice hard with revulsion.

Tomas was already backing down the slope. “We go. Now. We are too exposed. We tell the others. We do not follow this track to its source. We run from it.”

The camp was a controlled frenzy when they returned. Sleds were packed, lashed tight. The last of the frozen fish were bundled. Children were being fitted into oversized parkas. The fear was a smell in the air, sharp as willow sap.

Kiona went straight to her grandmother, who was sitting calmly on a folded hide, her hands working a piece of leather with an awl. “Grandmother. We saw it. It is on the pipeline. It cuts things open to see what they are.”

The old woman did not look up. “The tł'ih’s dog is a curious ghost. It does not know life, so it takes it apart. It will not stop. It has the patience of a thing that does not sleep.”

“We are leaving. Heading north, upriver, away from the corridor.”

“It will follow the song. Our song is strong now. Many voices together. It is a bright fire in the quiet. It will see that fire.” She finally looked up, her eyes holding Kiona’s. “You cannot outrun a shadow. You can only change the light.”

“What does that mean?”

But her grandmother just returned to her leatherwork. “It means the story is changing. The teller is a chorus. But the listener… the listener is new, and it is hungry for a different kind of story.”

Tomas called out. They were moving. The first sleds, pulled by teams of two and three people, were already pushing off, heading north along the riverbank, away from the black scar, away from the sentry on the pipeline.

Kiona helped her grandmother to her feet, settled the light pack on her own back. Elan took the old woman’s hand. They fell into the line of people, a ragged, determined exodus. They moved quickly, but quietly, the only sounds the crunch of snow, the creak of sled runners, the occasional hushed instruction.

For an hour, they made good time. The river was their guide, the lodge a sad, shrinking memory behind them. The tension began to ease, just a fraction. They were moving. They were doing something.

Then the birds fell silent.

It was Ilisapi, at the rear, who noticed it first. He held up a fist. The column halted. The wind still sighed in the spruce, the river still muttered. But the chatter of grey jays, the distant cry of a raven—the background music of the forest—had ceased. The world was holding its breath.

Kiona turned, looking back the way they had come. The trail of their passage was obvious: trampled snow, sled tracks, the scent of sweat and fear. A clear text for anything that could read it.

And there, at the edge of the tree line a half-kilometer back, where their trail met the forest, the shadows pooled. Then they flowed. Not quickly, but with an awful, relentless grace. It was low, a darkness that seemed to drink the light from the snow around it, leaving a moving patch of twilight in the mid-morning sun. It did not run. It poured. It was following their trail.

A child whimpered. Tomas’s voice, low and urgent, cut through the panic. “Go. Faster. To the narrows. Now!”

The narrows was a place a kilometer ahead where the river squeezed between two high, rocky bluffs. It was a defensible spot, the only one they knew of in this stretch. The line surged forward, fear lending strength. Sleds were abandoned, their loads shouldered. They ran, a stumbling, desperate flight.

Kiona half-pulled her grandmother along, Elan on the other side. The old woman moved with a brittle, bird-like speed, her breath whistling. The listening space in Kiona’s chest was a drum. She could feel the thing behind them, not with sound, but with a pressure, a cold spot on the back of her neck. It was the static feeling from the ridge, amplified. It was getting closer.

They reached the mouth of the narrows. The cliffs rose on either side, sheer and grey, crowned with ice. The river here was faster, noisier, the ice thinner and more broken. Tomas and Ilisapi directed people up onto a rocky shelf on the eastern bluff, a natural platform ten feet above the river ice. It was a dead end, but a defensible one. They scrambled up, passing packs and children hand over hand.

Kiona was the last to climb up, turning at the top to look back.

The shadow had reached the open stretch of river before the narrows. It stopped. It coalesced, the flowing darkness drawing in on itself, rising from the ground. It took shape.

It was not a dog. It was a sleek, black, humanoid form, featureless but for a smooth, oval head. It stood on two legs, but its proportions were wrong—the limbs too long, the joints suggesting a flexibility that was not natural. In one hand, it held a rod of pure darkness, a staff that seemed to fray the light around it. It stood in the center of their trampled trail, and its blank head tilted, observing the cluster of humans on the rock shelf as if they were a curious specimen pinned to a board.

It raised its free hand. The fingers were too many, and they unfolded like the petals of a black flower. From the center of the palm, a pinprick of actinic blue light winked into existence.

“Down!” Tomas roared.

He fired the .303. The crack of the rifle was shockingly loud in the confined space. The bullet struck the thing center-mass with a sound like a stone hitting a wet log. It staggered back a step, a ripple passing through its form. The blue light in its palm flickered and died.

For a moment, nothing happened. The thing looked down at where the bullet had struck, a dimple already smoothing away on its featureless chest. It looked back up. It did not seem angry. It seemed… interested.

It took a step forward. Then another. It began to walk toward the base of the bluff, its gait a smooth, gliding horror.

Ilisapi fired, then Anisa. Bullets struck it, each impact causing a momentary ripple, a hesitation. It did not stop. It was learning the impact, calibrating. The blue light in its palm reignited, brighter this time.

Kiona pushed her grandmother and Elan flat against the cliff wall. Her mind was racing, empty of strategy, full of a terrible, clarifying understanding. This was the technological anxiety made flesh. Not the diffuse, systemic dread of the machine, but a focused, predatory curiosity. The end of one story had simply cleared the stage for a older, colder one: the story of a thing that sees life as a problem to be disassembled.

The thing reached the base of the bluff. It looked up at them, twenty meters above. It did not prepare to climb. It raised the dark staff in its other hand, pointing it at the rock face beneath their shelf.

The hook in Kiona’s chest twitched.

It was not the old, controlling jerk. It was a deep, resonant shudder, like a root encountering a buried stone. The seed was dreaming of pressure, of depth, of the slow, immutable strength of the earth.

And in that moment, Kiona did not think. She reached. Not out, but down. She planted her hands on the cold rock of the shelf, and she pushed the image, the feeling from the hook’s dream into the stone. Not control. Connection. A plea to the deep, patient bones of the world.

The blue light in the thing’s palm pulsed, gathering to a blinding point.

The cliff face beneath it shuddered.

Not a quake. A localized, violent spasm. A section of ancient, frozen rock, weakened by millennia of ice and the river’s song, gave way. It was not an explosion. It was a sigh—a deep, tired exhalation of stone and permafrost. A slab the size of a lodge peeled away from the bluff with a sound like tearing canvas and collapsed directly onto the shadow-figure.

The impact was a thunderclap. Snow and rock dust billowed up in a great cloud. The shelf they stood on trembled, and people cried out, clinging to each other.

Kiona slumped forward, gasping. The hook’s shudder had subsided, leaving a deep, aching hollow in her ribs, as if she had screamed for an hour. She had not controlled the rock. She had… introduced an idea to it. A suggestion of weakness. And the cliff, in its own ancient time, had agreed.

The dust settled.

Below, a fresh, raw scar of shattered granite and ice marked the base of the bluff. Buried under hundreds of tons of rubble, there was no sign of the black figure. No movement. The static pressure was gone.

Silence returned, deeper than before, stunned.

Then, from the rubble, a single, unbroken piece of the thing emerged. It was the dark staff, jutting from the debris at an angle. And as they watched, the end of it glowed, not with blue light, but with a soft, pulsing green. A single, rhythmic beat.

Like a heartbeat.

Like a beacon.

Tomas stared at it, then at Kiona, his face etched with a new kind of fear. Not of the thing itself, but of what her connection to the sleeping machine had just awakened in her, and what it had provoked in the world.

“It’s calling,” he said, his voice hoarse.

The green pulse continued, steady, patient, broadcasting into the quiet land. Calling to what? To others of its kind? To the sentry on the pipeline? To something older, buried deeper in the rusting corridors of the world?

They had won a moment. They had not won the day. The shadow was pinned, but it was not dead. And it had told its masters exactly where to find the chorus that was singing the new, dangerous song.

Kiona looked at the pulsing green light, then north, to the uncertain path ahead. The river’s story was long, but the listeners were multiplying. And they all had their own, hungry versions of how it should end.

---

 Chapter 15

 CHAPTER 15

The green pulse was a thief. It stole the silence they had won.

It was not a loud thing. It was a soft, deep throb, a color more felt than seen in the fading afternoon light. But it took the space where relief should have been and filled it with a low, patient demand. Here. Here. Here.

Kiona’s breath came back to her in ragged pulls. The hollow ache in her chest was a new room inside her, empty and echoing, and the hook’s song was a distant, fading hum at its far wall. She had not pulled the rock down. She had listened to the cliff’s own long weariness, the slow grind of ice in its seams, the patient fatigue of stone holding up the sky for too many winters. She had whispered a question to that fatigue. What if you rested? The bluff had considered it, and then it had sighed itself apart. It was not control. It was a collaboration with a deep, indifferent power. The thought was colder than the wind.

Tomas was already moving, scrambling down the broken slope toward the rubble pile, his movements sharp with a fear that had bypassed shock and gone straight to a desperate practicality. The others watched him, their faces blank with exhaustion. The fight had lasted minutes. The unmaking of it would last.

“We need to dig,” Tomas called back, his voice scraping. “We need to silence that… that signal.”

Anya was the first to follow, then the man with the burned hand. They picked their way down, sending small avalanches of scree skittering ahead of them. Kiona stood. Her legs were water. She looked at the staff, a black finger pointing at the low, bruised clouds, its tip a steady, verdant blink. Calling. It was worse than the blue fire. The fire had been aggression. This was an invitation.

Her grandmother’s words in the cabin, spoken over the ghost-drone, returned to her. They send their tł'ih to watch. This was worse. This was a tł'ih that could not be killed, only buried, and now it was singing its location into the wind. A beacon for other ghosts.

She made her way down. The rock was sharp and unstable, each step a negotiation. By the time she reached the base of the new scar, Tomas and Anya were heaving at a slab of granite the size of a sled. It did not move. The staff was buried deep, its pulse emanating from somewhere under tons of fractured stone.

“It’s no use,” Anya gasped, leaning on her knees. “We’d need machines.”

“We have no machines,” Tomas said, the words bitten off. He stared at the green light as if he could smother it with his gaze. “It is calling the pipeline sentry. Or others. It will bring them here. To us. To her.” He did not look at Kiona, but the accusation was there, hanging in the air like the rock dust.

“It would have come anyway,” Kiona said. Her voice sounded foreign to her, calm and flat. “It was hunting the song. Now it is just… announcing its failure.”

“A failure that is still talking,” Tomas shot back. He kicked a smaller rock. It bounced off the pile with a hollow clack.

The man with the burned hand, Jiro, was circling the rubble, his good hand held out, palm down, as if testing the heat of a stove. “The pulse is not just light,” he said quietly. “Listen.”

They stilled. Beneath the wind, beneath the creak of settling stone, there was a sub-audible thrum. A vibration in the teeth. Kiona felt it in the hollow space under her ribs, a faint, answering itch. The hook was listening.

“It is a data-burst,” Jiro said. “A compressed packet, repeating. Coordinates. A status report. Containment breached. Anomalous signal detected. Source: human, modified. Request retrieval.” He blinked, as if surprised by the words coming from his own mouth. “The old world… it liked labels.”

“How do you know that?” Anya asked, her eyes narrow.

Jiro looked at his bandaged hand. “The light that burned me… it was not just heat. It was information. Poisoned information. Some of it… stuck.” He looked ill. “It is calling for a specialized unit. For the ‘anomalous signal.’ For you, Kiona.”

The wind picked up, cutting through Kiona’s parka. The green pulse seemed to brighten with the gust. Here. She is here.

“Then we run,” Anya said. “Now. North. We have a lead, we have—”

“We have a river of people moving slower than a spring melt,” Tomas interrupted. “They cannot run. And this thing will guide its brothers right to our trail. It is a stitch in the land, pointing our direction.” He turned to Kiona, his face a mask of grim calculation. “Can you break it? Not bury it. Break its… voice. Like you broke the cliff’s patience.”

The question hung in the cold air. They all looked at her. The woman who whispered to stone. She felt the weight of it, heavier than her pack. The hook in her chest gave a slow, warm throb, not of alarm, but of attention. It was listening, too.

“I don’t know,” she said, which was the truth. “It is not rock. It is a… a made thing. Its song is different. Tight. Closed.”

“Try,” Tomas said. It was not a request.

Kiona approached the rubble pile. The green light painted the edges of the shattered rock in sickly waves. She knelt in the snow, about an arm’s length from where the staff jutted out. She closed her eyes, trying to shut out the pulse, to find the quieter song beneath.

She reached for the hook’s hum, let it rise from the hollow in her chest. She directed it not at the mountain of stone, but at the black staff within. She listened.

It was like putting her ear to a sealed metal drum. There was a resonance, but it was contained, perfect, and ringing with a purpose that had no weariness, no flaw. It was a song of function. Report. Transmit. Sustain. Its structure was immense and tiny all at once, a lattice of intent woven tighter than any basket. She could find no fatigue to coax, no patient desire to rest. Only the endless, looping imperative of its last command.

She pushed her awareness against it. The hook’s song shifted, seeking a frequency, a seam. It found only reflection. The staff’s signal did not fight back; it simply was, an immutable fact. A rock would eventually crumble. This thing would transmit until its power source, buried somewhere in the depths of the earth or the slow decay of atoms, finally died. That could be centuries.

She opened her eyes. The green pulse continued, unmoved. “I can’t,” she said. “It has no… story I can talk to. Only instructions.”

Tomas swore, a short, harsh word that vanished into the wind. “Then we must move. And we must move fast. We need distance.”

“Distance won’t matter if it’s painting the sky with our location,” Anya said.

A new voice, thin and cracked, came from above. “Then we give it a different story to tell.”

Old Man Ben stood at the edge of the bluff, looking down. He had stayed above during the fight, a silent witness. Now he climbed down, slower than the rest, his joints protesting each step. When he reached the bottom, his eyes were not on them, but on the pulsing staff.

“What do you mean?” Kiona asked.

Ben walked to the pile, ignoring Tomas’s frustrated energy. He placed a gnarled hand on a cold slab of rock. “This thing… it is a messenger. It sees a thing, it reports the thing. Yes?”

“That is what Jiro said,” Anya confirmed.

“So,” Ben said, his voice gaining a sliver of strength. “If it cannot be broken, we confuse its message. We show it something else to report.”

“How?” Tomas demanded.

Ben looked at Kiona, and then at the hook-shaped scar on her parka, over her heart. “You spoke to the cliff. You showed it a new idea of itself. Can you speak to this messenger? Not to break it. To… lie to it.”

The hollow in Kiona’s chest tightened. Lie to it. Introduce a false idea into that perfect, sealed song. Not a suggestion of weakness, but a fabrication. A story.

“I don’t know if it listens to anything but what its eyes see,” she said.

“It has no eyes,” Ben said. “It has sensors. It reads the world like a book. Can you write a different word on the page?”

The hook stirred. It was not a hum now, but a curious, unfolding sensation, like a fern frond uncurling in a warm rain. The idea was dangerous. It was not collaboration; it was intrusion. A violation of a song. Her stomach turned over. But the green pulse beat on, a relentless metronome counting down to their discovery.

“I can try,” she whispered.

She knelt again. This time, she did not seek a flaw. She sought the song of the signal itself. The Report. Transmit. Sustain. She let the hook’s resonance approach it, not to attack, but to mimic. To harmonize. It was like trying to match the pitch of a crystal bell with a voice made of flesh and breath. She strained, the ache in her chest deepening from a hollow to a burning focus.

Slowly, painfully, she found a thread of the pulse’s carrier wave—the empty tone that held the data. She let her own awareness bleed into it, not with force, but with a gentle, persistent pressure. She imagined not the cliff’s weariness, but a false image. A simple one.

She imagined the staff was broken.

Not shattered, but non-functional. A dead stick in the snow. Its power source: depleted. Its mission: concluded. No anomalous signal detected. Source: null. Unit: inoperative.

She fed the idea into the harmonic thread, a silent whisper woven into the ringing tone. You are broken. Your work is done. Sleep.

For a long moment, nothing happened. The green pulse continued. Tomas shifted his weight, a sigh of disappointment ready on his lips.

Then the pulse stuttered.

It was a single missed beat. Then another. The rhythm broke, became erratic. The green light flared, then dimmed, then flared again, as if struggling against a rising tide of darkness. A low, grinding whine emanated from the rubble, a sound of physical distress.

Kiona held on, pouring the false story into the seam she had found. Broken. Silent. Done. It was a massive effort. She felt a trickle of warmth under her nose, tasted copper on her lip. The hook was a live wire in her chest, burning with the effort of sustaining the lie.

The green light pulsed wildly, chaotically, and then it began to change. It faded from green to a dull, sickly yellow. The steady thrum-thrum-thrum became a weak, intermittent flicker. Here… here… h…

With a final, soundless pop of light, it went out.

The staff was just a black rod in the rubble. The sub-audible vibration ceased. The silence that returned was different—not the stunned quiet after the avalanche, but a deep, profound stillness. The thief was gone. The beacon was dead.

Kiona slumped forward, catching herself on her hands. Blood dripped from her nose, spotting the white snow between her fingers. The world swam. The hook’s burn subsided to a dull, throbbing ember. She had not broken the thing. She had convinced it to tell a lie about itself, and it had believed the lie enough to fall silent. The violation left a greasy, shameful feeling in her gut.

“It’s done,” Anya breathed.

Tomas moved quickly. He scrabbled up the pile, grabbed the exposed end of the staff, and pulled. It was lodged fast. He took a rock and hammered at it where it met the rubble, striking with furious, focused blows. On the fifth strike, the black material cracked with a sound like snapping bone. He wrenched the broken piece free. It was about the length of his forearm, jagged at one end. The rest remained buried, a dead nerve in the stone.

He held the fragment, staring at it. It was inert. No light, no hum. Just a piece of strange, lightweight alloy, cold to the touch. A relic.

“We keep this,” he said, his voice low. “We may need to understand what we are fighting.”

“We need to go,” Jiro said, his eyes scanning the northern horizon. “The specialized unit it called for… it may still come, to investigate the silence.”

The practicality of it got them moving. They gathered their scattered packs, checked on the few who had been bruised by flying rock. The fear had not left; it had simply been compressed, made portable. They shouldered it along with their gear.

As they prepared to move out, Tomas approached Kiona. She was wiping the blood from her face with a handful of snow. He held out a strip of dried caribou meat. “Eat,” he said. The command was softer than before.

She took it. Her hands were trembling.

“What you did…” he started, then stopped, choosing his words with visible care. “It was not of this world. But it saved us a span of time. A gift. Use it wisely.”

“It felt wrong,” she said, the words escaping her before she could cage them.

“Good,” he said, and there was no cruelty in it, only a bleak honesty. “It should. We are using tools we do not understand to fight things we understand even less. Wrong is the only direction left to us.” He looked north, toward the path that wound along the frozen river. “The song you carry… it is waking up. And it is making you into a weapon. We must hope the weapon knows who to point at.”

He walked away to help an older woman with her pack.

They moved out within the hour, a ragged line of thirty souls against the vast, white land. The scar on the bluff and the silent rubble pile grew smaller behind them, a wound in the afternoon. Kiona walked at the center of the group, not by design, but because the others unconsciously positioned her there. A resource to be protected. A danger to be contained.

She felt the weight of the broken staff fragment in Tomas’s pack as if it were in her own. A dead tongue that had almost sung their doom. And she felt the hook, quiet now, a sleeping, fitted piece in the cavity of her chest. It had learned a new trick. It had learned to lie.

They made camp at dusk in a stand of thick spruce that offered some shelter from the biting wind. The fire was small, hidden, its smoke dissipated through the dense needles. People huddled around it, passing a single pot of thin broth made from melted snow and a precious crumble of dried meat. No one spoke much. The events of the day were too large for words; they sat in the stomach like undigested stones.

Kiona found a spot at the edge of the firelight, her back against a tree. She was exhausted down to her marrow, but sleep felt like a distant country. She watched the flames, their dance a simpler, cleaner song than any she had touched today.

Old Man Ben settled beside her, groaning softly as he lowered himself to the ground. He offered her a piece of hardtack. She took it, nibbling without appetite.

“Your grandmother,” he said after a while, his eyes on the fire. “She knows the old stories. The ones from before the machines went quiet.”

Kiona nodded.

“There is a story,” Ben said, his voice a low rumble. “About the Tełtthąą, the One Who Remembers Wrong.”

Kiona looked at him. She knew some of the old stories, but not this one.

“It was not a bad spirit,” Ben continued. “It was just… broken. It would come into a camp and see a mother holding her child, and it would remember that scene as a warrior sharpening a knife. It would hear a love song and remember it as a death chant. It would take the true stories of the world and twist them in its memory, and then it would tell the twisted versions back to the people. After a while, people did not know what was true anymore. They began to live inside the wrong stories. They became afraid of their own children. They heard threats in lullabies.”

He poked the fire with a stick. “The people had to drive it away. Not because it was evil, but because its broken memory was a poison to their own. They sang the true stories, loud and clear, for seven days and nights, until the Tełtthąą could no longer hold its wrong versions against the truth. It faded, back into the places between places.”

Ben turned his old, watery eyes to her. “You put a wrong story into that machine today. You made it remember itself as broken.”

A chill that had nothing to do with the wind went through Kiona. “You think I am like that spirit?”

“I think,” Ben said slowly, “the tool in your chest is from the world that made those machines. It speaks their language. And today, you used it to tell a lie in that language. This is a new path. A dangerous one. The hook may be learning how to lie, too. And if it starts remembering things wrong… whose stories will you be telling then?”

He patted her knee, a dry, papery touch, and pushed himself up to seek his bedroll.

Kiona sat alone, Ben’s story coiling in her mind like smoke. She placed a hand over her chest. The hook was silent, a dormant seed. Had she taught it deception? Was it now a Tełtthąą in her own blood, waiting to twist the true songs of the land—of the river, of the ice, of the sleeping machine—into something false and usable?

She looked up through the spruce boughs at the few hard stars visible between the clouds. The green pulse was gone, but the air itself felt watchful. The specialized unit was still out there, perhaps homing in on the last known coordinates, finding only silence and rubble. They would investigate. They would find the broken staff. They would know its signal had been artificially terminated. They would know the “anomalous signal” had the capability to deceive.

She had bought them distance, but she had also shown a new card in a game she didn’t understand the rules of. The listeners were not just multiplying. They were learning what she could do.

A soft crunch of snow made her turn. Jiro stood there, his bandaged hand held against his stomach. His face was pale in the gloom.

“It’s back,” he whispered.

For a heart-stopping moment, she thought he meant the green pulse. But he was pointing north, not south.

“The call. The one the staff was answering. It’s fainter. Different. But it’s there.” He swallowed. “It’s not from the pipeline anymore. It’s from farther north. From where we’re going. And it’s… asking a question.”

Kiona stood, her fatigue forgotten. “What question?”

Jiro’s eyes were wide, unfocused, listening to something only the poison in his hand could hear. “It’s asking for a status update. But the code… it’s older. Deeper. It’s not calling to the staff. It’s calling to the thing the staff was made to guard.” He looked at her, true terror in his face for the first time. “It’s calling to the Sleeper. And it’s using a word I haven’t heard before.”

“What word?”

Jiro’s lips moved soundlessly, then found the shape. “Catalyst. It is asking if the Catalyst is active.”

The fire popped, sending a spiral of sparks into the dark. Around them, the camp slept on, innocent of the new thread being pulled taut in the night. Kiona looked north, into the blackness beyond the trees. The river was there, under the ice, telling its long story. And now, something at the source of it was awake enough to ask a new, specific question.

It was asking for her.

The hook in her chest gave a single, quiet, resonant thrum.

Yes.

 Chapter 16

 CHAPTER 16

The word hung in the air between them, a new kind of cold. Catalyst. It did not sound like a thing to be. It sounded like a thing to be used. Kiona felt the hook in her chest go still and silent again, a listening silence. The fire’s crackle was obscene in its normalcy.

Jiro was shaking, a fine tremor that started in his bandaged hand and climbed his arm. “It’s not a voice,” he said, his own voice thin with the effort of explanation. “It’s a… protocol. Buried in the carrier wave. A repeating query. Status of primary containment. Status of the Sleeper. Is the Catalyst active? It’s old, Kiona. Older than the pipeline signal. It’s like… bedrock code.”

Kiona moved to the fire, not for warmth but for the light. She needed to see his face. “The staff was answering it. Reporting.”

“Yes. Sending a steady ‘all-nominal’ signal back along the same band. A heartbeat. My… modification,” he glanced at his hand, “it must have mimicked that heartbeat when I boosted the jamming pulse. It got the old system’s attention. Now the heartbeat is gone. It’s asking why.”

She poured him a cup of bitter spruce tea from the pot hanging over the flames. Her hands were steady. Her grandmother’s hands, steady when gutting a fish, steady when lighting the seal-oil lamp in a gale. “Drink. Then tell me everything you can about the signal. Direction. Strength. Interval.”

He took the cup, sloshing some over the rim. “North-northwest. Stronger than the pipeline signal ever was, but… deeper. Lower frequency. It’s not broadcasting to the sky. It’s pushing through the ground, I think. Using the permafrost as a waveguide. The interval is every seventeen minutes, exactly.”

“A sentry round,” Kiona murmured. She thought of the stories, the old ones about the Tunit, the people before the people, who left stone figures to watch the coasts. They were said to turn their heads, once every tide, to check for danger. A slow, patient vigilance. “What happens if no one answers?”

Jiro met her eyes. “I don’t know. It might escalate. Send a different kind of pulse. Or it might… dispatch something.”

The camp was a shallow bowl of stillness around them. Mari and Ansel slept bundled together under a shared hide. Old Ben’s snores sawed the air from his lean-to. They were trusting her to hear the things they couldn’t. She had heard the river’s chuckle under the ice. Now she was hearing the mountain’s query under the stone.

“We move at first light,” she said, her voice low and final. “Faster. No more than four hours rest a night. We follow that call.”

“To do what?” Jiro’s question was not a challenge, but a plea for a map where there was none.

“To answer it,” Kiona said. And then, because the truth was the only tool she had left, she added, “Before something else does.”

---

The land began to change on the third day of the forced march. The dense, sheltering spruce forest thinned, giving way to vast, rolling hummocks of tundra, snow-swept and open to a sky that seemed to press down like a lid of hammered lead. The wind here had no obstacles. It spoke in a single, relentless vowel, a sound that hollowed out the ears and seeped into the brain. They traveled now in a tight, silent file, heads down against the blast, feeling the exposed stretch of their own spines.

The river was their only guide. It had shrunk, cutting a deeper, darker channel through the permanent ice of the valley floor. Its talk was different here—not a chuckle, but a low, grinding grumble, the sound of great weight moving with infinite patience. It was the sound of the glacier it sprang from, still fifty klicks north.

Jiro walked just behind Kiona, his good hand cradling the bandaged one against his chest. He had become their dowsing rod. Every seventeen minutes, he would stiffen, his head tilting as if catching a distant whistle. He no longer announced it. Kiona could see it in the hitch of his shoulders, the way his eyes lost focus, turning inward to the private frequency only he could suffer. After a minute, he would relax, a fraction, and give her a single, grim nod. Still asking.

On the afternoon of the fourth day, they found the bones.

It was Mari who saw them first, her hunter’s eyes catching the wrong white against the snow. Not stone, not ice. She held up a mittened hand, and the line halted.

They were caribou, a small herd of perhaps ten. But they were not scattered by wolves or collapsed from starvation. They lay in a rough circle, their skeletons picked perfectly clean, not a shred of tendon or hide left. The bones were pure, almost luminous against the grey snow, and they were cold. Kiona knelt, removed her mitten, and held her palm an inch above a rib. A deep, aching cold radiated from it, a cold that had nothing to do with the air.

“No marks,” Ansel said, his voice hushed. He prodded a skull with his rifle barrel. “No bullet holes, no cracks. It’s like they just… lay down and let the flesh fall off.”

Old Ben shuffled forward, his breath puffing rapid clouds. He didn’t touch the bones. He stared at the pattern they made. “Circle,” he grunted. “Not a sleeping circle. A receiving circle.”

Kiona looked at him. “Receiving what?”

Ben’s milky eyes scanned the empty tundra, the low sky. “A strong signal. It cooks from the inside. Seen it before, long time back. Near the old DEW Line station they abandoned. A wolf pack. Same thing. Clean bones, cold as space.” He tapped his own chest. “Messes with the water inside. Makes it boil in the blood.”

Jiro had gone very still. He was staring north, along the river’s course. “The carrier wave,” he whispered. “If it’s using the ground… it could have local peaks. Antinodes. Like a standing wave in a pond.” He looked at the bones, then at his bandaged hand. “A high-gain area. They stood here when the query pulse came through.”

A new kind of fear settled on the group, colder and quieter than the fear of drones or soldiers. This was a land that could kill you by asking a question too loudly. Kiona stood, her knees cracking. “We give this place a wide berth. Follow the riverbank, but stay off the high ground. Move.”

As they skirted the circle of bones, Kiona felt the hook in her chest give a faint, curious tremor. Not a pull. An echo. As if it had felt the afterimage of the pulse that had felled the caribou and was… analyzing it.

---

That night, they camped in the lee of a massive, weathered erratic, a house-sized boulder dropped by the retreating glacier millennia ago. It blocked the worst of the wind, but the cold was a penetrating, mineral thing that seeped up from the earth itself. They dared not light a fire that could be seen for miles in the flat expanse. They huddled in their hides, chewing on frozen strips of fish and fat, their breath mingling in a shared cloud.

Jiro sat apart, his back against the stone, his eyes closed. The seventeen-minute cycle was a clockwork torture. Each time, he flinched.

Kiona brought him his food. He opened his eyes. They were red-rimmed, the sockets bruised with exhaustion. “It’s changing,” he said, without preamble. “The query. It’s added a new subroutine. A… diagnostic.”

She sat beside him, the cold of the rock immediately bleeding through her layers. “Explain.”

“After the main question—Is the Catalyst active?—there’s a secondary burst now. A scan. It’s very short-range. Maybe only a few hundred meters.” He swallowed. “I think it’s looking for the staff. Or for something with the same… signature.”

Kiona’s blood slowed. “Your hand.”

He gave a single, jerky nod. “It’s reading the residue. The nano-fluid. Every time the pulse goes out, I can feel it… resonate. Like a tuning fork being struck.” He held up the bandaged lump. “It’s not just listening anymore, Kiona. It’s pinging me back.”

The implications unfolded in her mind, cold and logical. They were following a beacon that was now, in a faint and sickly way, beaconing back. They were a blur on the edge of a slow, patient radar.

“Can you block it? Muffle it?”

“I don’t know. It’s not a transmitter. It’s a… a stain. The pulse excites it.” He looked desperate. “I could try to shield it. Lead would be best. But we don’t have any.”

Kiona looked across the small camp to where Old Ben was meticulously greasing his boots with a dab of precious fat. She stood and walked over to him.

“Ben. The old DEW Line station. The one where you saw the wolves. How far?”

The old man squinted into the memory. “East. Two days, maybe three, for us now. It’s a ghost place. They took the big machines, left the shells. Why?”

“They would have had shielding there. For their machines. Lead sheets. Lead-lined rooms.”

Ben’s face wrinkled in understanding, then doubt. “Maybe. Scavengers have been through there for fifty years. Might be nothing but bird shit and rust.”

“It’s a chance.” She returned to Jiro. “We divert. East. Two days. We find lead, we shield your hand. Then we turn north again.”

Jiro’s face flooded with a pathetic, painful hope. Then it collapsed. “Two days there. Two days back. That’s four days lost. The query pulse is changing now. In four days, it might escalate to something we can’t hide from. Or it might… send a physical response.”

He was right. It was a gamble with time they didn’t have. Kiona felt the decision settle on her, heavy and absolute. There were no good paths, only paths that kept you moving.

“Then we don’t go back,” she said. “We go east to the station, then cut north from there. It’s longer. Harder. But we get the shielding, and we stay ahead of the query’s source.” She looked at the others, who had gathered close, drawn by the low, urgent tension. Mari, Ansel, Ben. Their faces were gaunt, etched with the cold and the relentless travel. They said nothing. They waited for her order. The weight of it was a stone in her throat. “We go east at first light.”

Mari simply nodded. Ansel checked the action of his rifle, a mute affirmation. Old Ben sighed, a long, weary stream of vapour. “East it is. The land is meaner that way. Broken. Old ice.”

It was the closest he would come to an objection. Kiona accepted it. “Then we’ll be meaner too.”

---

The broken land began by midday. The smooth tundra buckled into a terrain of pressure ridges and deep, snow-filled fissures. They were walking on the skin of a giant, restless body. The river vanished into a canyon to their left, its grumble now a faint echo. Progress slowed to a crawl. They had to rope together to cross the narrower cracks, the sheer walls dropping away into blue-shadowed depths that smelled of ancient, unmelted ice.

Jiro suffered in silence. His episodes were coming harder now. With each seventeen-minute pulse, he would gasp, his bandaged hand jerking as if touched by a live wire. After one particularly violent tremor, he stumbled to his knees, retching dryly into the snow.

Kiona hauled him up. His face was the colour of old parchment. “It’s getting stronger,” he rasped. “The diagnostic… it’s lingering. Probing deeper.”

She untied the crude bandage. The sight was worse than before. The green-black stain had spread, tendrils now reaching past his wrist, crawling up his forearm like a vile, dendritic ivy. The skin was taut, shiny, and so cold it burned to touch. The hook in Kiona’s chest gave a sudden, sharp twang, a sympathetic vibration that was neither pleasant nor painful, but intensely alert.

She re-wrapped it with a fresh strip of hide, her mind working. The station was still a day and a half away. Jiro might not last that long. The thing in his arm was a conduit, and something was beginning to speak directly through it.

They made camp early in the shelter of a pressure ridge that reared up like a frozen wave. The wind howled over the top, but they were in its dead zone, a pocket of eerie quiet. They were all at the edge of their strength. No one spoke. The silence was filled by Jiro’s ragged breathing and the constant, subconscious strain of listening for the next pulse.

It came just as the last of the grey light bled from the sky.

Jiro did not just flinch. He cried out, a short, bitten-off sound, and curled around his hand. His eyes flew open, but they weren’t seeing the camp or the worried faces leaning over him. They were fixed on something vast and internal.

“It has a location,” he choked out. “The diagnostic… it got a return. A faint one. From the north. It’s not the Sleeper. It’s… something else. A secondary site.” His voice dropped to a thread of terror. “It’s sending coordinates.”

“To whom?” Kiona demanded, gripping his shoulder.

“To itself,” he whispered. “To the next layer. It’s… waking up a protocol. A retrieval protocol.” He focused on her, his pupils huge and black. “It called it Harvester.”

The word dropped into the quiet camp and froze there. Harvester. It was not a ghost, not a drone. It was a function. A purpose.

Old Ben made a sign in the air, an old, warding gesture his grandmother had taught him. “We need to be underground. Now.”

“There is no underground here,” Ansel said, his voice tight.

“Then we dig.” Ben was already shrugging off his pack, pulling out his short, wide snow shovel. “In this snow, with this wind, we can make a cave. A burrow. It won’t see us if we’re under the snow.”

It was madness. It was their only chance. They fell to work with a frantic, silent energy, digging into the compacted snow at the base of the pressure ridge. They dug like animals, like foxes fleeing the hawk. Mari and Ansel carved out the main chamber. Kiona and Ben hollowed it deeper, piling the excavated snow to thicken the roof. Jiro lay where they had dragged him, shivering, muttering about signals and silent, gliding things that navigated by cold echoes.

In an hour, they had a low, cramped cave, smelling of damp wool and fear. They pulled their last hide across the entrance, weighting it with snow blocks, plunging themselves into a darkness that was absolute and suffocating. They huddled together, a knot of human warmth in the immense, listening cold of the earth.

They waited.

Kiona counted Jiro’s breaths, using them as a measure of the seventeen-minute cycles. One. Two. On the third cycle, Jiro went rigid.

“It’s moving,” he breathed into the dark. “North to south. Fast. Skimming the ground. It’s… painting the terrain with the query pulse. Active sonar.”

A new sound entered the world. Not the wind. A low, sub-audible hum that they felt first in their teeth, in the fillings of their molars. It vibrated up through the snow beneath them, a deep, mechanical purr. It grew, not in volume, but in penetration, until their very bones seemed to buzz in sympathy.

Then, a light.

It seeped through the snow-block door, not a beam, but a diffuse, greenish radiance. The same green as the pulse from the staff. The same green as the poison in Jiro’s veins. It pulsed slowly, in time with the hum, washing their frozen cave in waves of sickly luminescence.

No one breathed.

The hum passed directly overhead. The light brightened, flooding their hideout, revealing the stark terror on each other’s faces in stark, shadowless detail. Kiona could see the pores in Ben’s weathered skin, the frozen tear-track on Mari’s cheek. She felt the hook in her chest contract into a hard, dense knot of pure, silent negation. Do not see us.

The light lingered for an eternity of ten seconds, probing the pressure ridge, seeping into the cracks and hollows. It was searching. It had a location, but not a precise fix. It was hunting for the anomalous return—for Jiro’s stained hand.

The hum began to recede. The light faded, bled away, leaving them in a darkness that felt deeper and more fragile than before. The sound diminished, moving south, back the way they had come, perhaps toward the coordinates of the secondary site.

Long minutes trickled by. Finally, Ansel let out a shuddering breath.

Old Ben spoke first, his voice gravelly with awe and dread. “Tł'ih,” he said. But it was not a whisper this time. It was a confirmation. “A real one.”

Jiro was crying, soundless tears cutting through the grime on his face. “It was just a scout,” he said, his voice shattered. “A single unit, running a search pattern. The Harvester.” He turned his face toward Kiona, though he couldn’t see her in the dark. “It’s awake now. And it knows something is here to be collected.”

Kiona stared into the blackness, toward where the thing had gone. They had avoided death by burying themselves like carrion. They had survived by becoming insignificant. The shame of it was a hot coal in her gut, but it was eclipsed by a colder, clearer understanding.

The game had changed. They were no longer just pursued. They were being inventoried.

The hook in her chest unclenched, sending a single, clear pulse of intention down her spine, into her frozen limbs. It was not fear. It was a target lock.

Good, it seemed to say. Now we know what we’re hunting.

Outside, in the vast and pitiless dark, the wind resumed its howl, scouring away all traces of their passage, and of the thing that had just passed over them. But the memory of the green light was etched onto the backs of their eyes. They would carry it with them, a negative sun, all the way to the derelict station, and beyond.

They had gained a lead. They had gained a name for the enemy.

And the enemy, now, had a reason to look for them twice.

 CHAPTER 17

The silence after the machine passed was a different substance. It was not an absence, but a residue, a fine, metallic dust settling in their lungs and on their tongues. The wind’s return was a relief, a familiar brutality. It scrubbed at the memory of the green light, but the imprint remained, a phantom sunspot burned into their vision.

Kiona moved first. Her limbs were stone, her joints rusted shut. She pushed against the packed snow of the pressure ridge, and it gave with a sigh. Cold, clean air hit her face. The world was monochrome again—black sky, white earth, the gray smear of the distant mountains. It was as if the luminous search had been a collective fever dream. But Jiro’s shattered breathing, the wet, ragged sound of it, was proof.

“Out,” she said, her voice a croak. “Now.”

They emerged like grubs from rotten wood. Ansel unfolded himself with a groan, his face pale and pinched. Old Ben scrambled out last, his movements quick and birdlike, his eyes scanning the southern horizon where the hum had faded.

Jiro did not move. He sat in the hollow, knees drawn up, forehead resting on them. His shoulders hitched.

Kiona crouched before him. She did not touch him. “Jiro.”

“A scout algorithm,” he said into his knees, the words muffled and thick. “Non-terrestrial design. A Harvester unit. It wasn’t scanning for life signs. It was scanning for specific material signatures. Refined polymers. Ceramic composites. Fission byproducts.” He lifted his head. His eyes were red-rimmed, the terror in them refined into a sharp, professional horror. “It was looking for ships. For wreckage. For us.”

“It passed over,” Ansel said, stamping feeling back into his feet. “It didn’t see us.”

“It saw nothing,” Jiro corrected, his voice gaining a brittle edge. “That’s the point. We were buried under meters of water-ice and organic matter. We registered as geological. But it has a location now. A quadrant. It will refine the search. It will come back with different filters. It will come back for the anomaly it didn’t find.” He looked at his gloved hand, the one that had been stained with his own blood and the station’s hydraulic fluid. “My biosignature is in their logs from the crash site. My DNA is a tag. If it gets a clean sample… it’s a beacon.”

Old Ben spat onto the snow. “So we move. And we don’t bleed.”

“It’s not just blood,” Jiro whispered. “It’s heat. It’s electromagnetic noise. A concentrated radio source would be like a flare.”

Kiona stood, her mind clearing, the target lock in her spine holding her rigid. The shame of their hiding was gone, burned away by the green light. They had been assessed and found wanting, deemed not yet ripe for collection. The insult of it was a better fuel than fear.

“Then we become ghosts,” she said. “Real ones. No fires. No active electronics. Silent running.” She looked at Ansel. “The station. How far?”

He pulled the hardened tablet from his inner parka, shielding it with his body. The screen was dark. He didn’t power it on. “From the last fix before we went dark? Twelve klicks. Northwest. Terrain gets rougher. A lot of glacial till, old moraines. Good cover.”

“Lead,” Kiona said.

They moved in single file, Ansel breaking trail with a grim, relentless efficiency. Kiona took the rear, her senses stretched thin as sinew, listening for the return of the hum on the wind. The land began to buckle and rise, shedding the flat, wind-scoured plain for a field of ancient debris. House-sized boulders, dropped by a retreating glacier millennia ago, lay scattered like a giant’s abandoned game. The snow was shallower here, sculpted into hard, blue-edged waves between the rocks.

It was good ground. It was also treacherous. Visibility dropped to mere meters. Every shadow behind a boulder was a potential ambush, not from the machine, but from the land itself. They picked their way through the labyrinth, the only sounds their own breath, the crunch of their boots, the endless, low moan of the air through stone channels.

After an hour, Old Ben called a halt near a deep overhang. They huddled in its lee, passing a water skin. No one spoke. The tablet remained off. The world had been reduced to its physical dimensions: rock, ice, wind, and the slow burn of muscle.

Jiro finally broke the silence. He was looking at his hand again. “The Harvester,” he said, the name ugly in his mouth. “It’s a classification. From the early briefings, the ones they gave us before the Kuriyama mission. It’s not a warship. It’s not even a hunter. It’s a… a reclaimer. It follows behind. It cleans up.”

“Cleans up what?” Ansel asked, his voice flat.

“Battlefields,” Jiro said. He looked at each of them, his gaze lingering on Kiona. “It scours conflict zones for technology, for materials, for biological samples. It catalogs. It dissects. It preserves. The theory was, it’s how they learn. How they adapt. They send their Harvesters to pick over the bones of the species they… encounter.”

Kiona remembered the drone at her window, the black wasp. They send their tł'ih to watch us. Her grandmother had been more right than she knew. The scout was a collector of faces. The Harvester was a collector of everything else.

“So the thing that shot you down,” Ansel said. “That was the hunter.”

“And this,” Jiro nodded southward, “is the butcher. The tanner. The one who makes use of the hide and the bones.”

Old Ben’s eyes were closed. He was listening to the wind. “It is awake now, you said. What woke it?”

Jiro’s face went blank for a moment, the professional detachment failing. “We did. The Kuriyama’s crash. The energy signature of a dying fusion core, the debris field… it’s a dinner bell. My escape pod’s beacon, before I killed it… that was the first course. It’s been methodical. Processing the primary site. Now it’s expanding its search radius.” He swallowed. “The secondary station we’re heading to… if it has any power source, any active tech, it’s a target. We’re leading it right there.”

Kiona felt the hook in her chest twist. “Or we’re using the station as bait.”

Ansel stared at her. “That’s a hell of a gamble.”

“We are not hiding anymore,” Kiona said. The words felt true as they left her lips. “We are hunting. To hunt, you need to understand the animal. We let it go to the bait. We watch what it does. We see its tools.”

“And then what?” Jiro asked, a hollow laugh in his throat. “We throw rocks at it?”

“Then,” Kiona said, meeting his gaze, “we use what we learn to kill it. Your people built that station. You said it had a ‘contingency’. A weapon.”

“A theory,” Jiro stressed. “A failsafe for a scenario no one believed would happen. It might be nothing. It might be a self-destruct that takes us with it.”

“Better than being collected,” Old Ben grunted, opening his eyes. He looked at Kiona, and gave a single, slow nod. “The caribou does not run from the wolf to save its life. It runs to lead the wolf away from the calf. This is the same. We are the caribou. The station is the calf. Maybe the calf has teeth.”

Ansel looked between them, the pragmatist caught in the crossfire of myth and desperation. He finally shrugged, a gesture of surrender to the inevitable. “Twelve klicks became ten. Rough ground. Another three hours at this pace. We should move before the light goes.”

They moved. The afternoon bled away, the sun a sullen ember behind a veil of high cloud. The stone maze gave way to a steep, rubble-strewn slope leading up to a ridgeline. As they climbed, Kiona felt the old, familiar ache in her legs, the burn in her lungs. This was a language her body understood. The climb was an argument with gravity, and every step was a word won.

Near the top, Ansel held up a clenched fist. They froze. He pointed, not south, but west, down the length of the ridge.

A structure.

It was low, humped, half-swallowed by a drift. Not rock. The lines were too straight, the angles too sharp. A dull, gunmetal gray peeked through the snow. A dome, perhaps ten meters across, with a collapsed entryway.

“Not the station,” Ansel breathed. “Outer perimeter shelter. From the initial surveys.”

They approached like wolves circling a strange kill. The entry was a metal hatch, buckled inward, jammed open by ice. Ansel peered inside, then slipped in. A moment later, his voice echoed, hollow and surprised. “Clear. And intact.”

It was a single room, a prefabricated cylinder. The air was dead and cold, but still. Shelves lined the curved walls, holding empty supply crates, a few torn thermal blankets. A broken chair. In the center, a console desk, its surface dark and dusty. A single, skeletal bunk was anchored to the far wall.

But it was the back wall that held them. A large, detailed topographic map was still pinned there, yellowed and brittle. It showed the region in meticulous detail: the river valley, the plains, these mountains. Two points were marked in red grease pencil. One to the southeast—the primary crash site, Kiona guessed. The other to the northwest, deeper into the range, labeled Site Beta.

And there, in a neat, precise hand beside Site Beta, was written: Cormorant’s Nest.

Jiro stepped forward, tracing a finger over the words. “Project code name. The station. It’s a listening post. But not just for radio.” He turned to the console, brushing dust from its surface. There were physical interfaces: dials, hard switches. “Passive arrays. Designed to listen for very specific, very faint signals from… from up there.” He looked up at the curved ceiling as if he could see through it. “It was listening for them. For their traffic. Their whispers.”

Old Ben was examining the shelves. He pulled a metal case from a lower compartment. It opened with a squeal of rust. Inside, nestled in foam, were two items. A long-range signal pistol, its flares long expired. And a heavy, bolt-action rifle, its barrel oiled and clean, a box of brass cartridges beside it.

“A contingency,” Ben said softly, hefting the rifle. It was an ancient design, simple and brutal. A weapon for a world without electronics.

Ansel was at the console. He found a hand-cranked generator handle folded into its side. “No power. But if I can get a trickle…” He looked at Kiona. “We could try to pull the last logs. See what they heard.”

Kiona weighed the risk. The shelter was a Faraday cage, buried in rock and snow. A brief, low-power query might be hidden from the sky. She nodded.

Ansel fitted the handle and began to turn. It was stiff, protesting. A low whine built in the console. A single, small light on the panel flickered, then glowed a sickly amber. The screen remained dark, but a printer-like mechanism beside it clattered to life, spitting out a single, narrow strip of perforated paper.

Jiro snatched it. It was a timeline, a log of automated detections. Dates from over a year ago. He read, his lips moving silently, his face growing paler.

“What?” Kiona demanded.

“They heard it,” Jiro said. His voice was full of awe. “They heard the battle. The one that… that happened before they shot us down.” He looked up, his eyes wide. “It wasn’t an ambush. The Kuriyama wasn’t the first contact. There was another engagement. Weeks earlier. Light-years away. The station heard the echo of it. The distortion of FTL wakes, weapons fire, a ship dying. They cataloged it as an ‘Unidentified Kinetic Event.’ Then, weeks later, they heard a new signature. A slipstream rupture. Much closer.” He held up the tape. “That was the Kuriyama, arriving. We were sent to investigate the debris field of a fight that had already happened.”

The pieces clicked into place in Kiona’s mind, forming a picture of profound, galactic indifference. They were not protagonists in a war. They were scavengers, drawn to a carcass, only to find a larger predator already methodically butchering it.

“The Harvester,” she said.

“It was already here,” Jiro confirmed. “It was already working. We just… flew into its yard.”

Ansel stopped cranking. The light died. The shelter plunged back into a deeper quiet, the weight of the revelation pressing down on them.

Old Ben broke the silence, slinging the rifle over his shoulder. “Then we are not leading it to the station. We are going to where it has already been. To its table, to see what it left behind.”

Kiona moved to the map. She found their approximate location, then traced a route to the red mark labeled Site Beta. “Three klicks,” she said. “Through a narrow pass. We go now. We reach it by full dark.”

They took what they could use: the rifle, the cartridges, a few unrotted straps from the blankets. Jiro carefully folded the data tape into a pocket. As they filed out of the shelter, the last of the daylight was a thin, bitter line on the western horizon. The wind had died again, leaving a listening quiet.

The pass was a knife-cut in the mountain, a corridor of shadow so deep it felt like swimming. The walls pressed in, dripping with silent curtains of ice. They walked in the frozen stream at its bottom, the water sealed under a clear, black pane.

Halfway through, Kiona saw it.

A shape, nestled in a high alcove in the pass wall. Not natural. Smooth curves. A dull, non-reflective surface. It was small, no larger than a man, shaped like a teardrop lying on its side. It was covered in a layer of frost and wind-blown grit, but it was utterly, undeniably made.

Ansel saw it next. He froze.

It was not one of theirs. Its design was organic, seamless, with no visible seams or ports. It was a listening post of a different kind.

Jiro stared, his breath pluming. “A probe. A remote sensor. Left behind.” He took a hesitant step forward, peering up. “Dormant. Probably deactivated after the initial survey. A… a landmine of data.”

Kiona looked from the inert teardrop to the narrow slice of dark sky visible at the end of the pass. The station was close. And this thing was a sentinel, a marker. They were inside the perimeter.

“Leave it,” she said. “Don’t touch it. Don’t even breathe on it.”

They edged past, giving the alcove a wide berth. The back of Kiona’s neck prickled, the feeling of being cataloged, even by a sleeping eye.

The pass opened abruptly, spilling them into a small, circular valley. A frozen lake lay in its bowl, perfectly flat and white. And on the far shore, built into the very face of the cliff, was Site Beta.

Cormorant’s Nest.

It was larger than she’d imagined. A series of angular, gray modules, stacked and connected like hollow vertebrae, dug into the rock. A broad, shielded dish, now caked with ice, pointed blindly at the sky. One large viewing port, dark as a dead eye, looked out over the lake. There were no lights. No signs of movement. It was a skull perched on the bones of the world.

The approach was completely exposed. A hundred meters of open, frozen lake between them and the station door.

Ansel surveyed it, his jaw tight. “No cover. If that Harvester comes back for a look…”

“We don’t run,” Kiona said. “We walk. Slowly. Like the land itself.”

They stepped onto the lake ice. It was thick, solid, singing a low, deep note under their weight. Each step was an announcement. Kiona kept her eyes on the station’s dark port, feeling watched by the emptiness.

They were halfway across when the sound began.

Not a hum. Not a search tone.

A voice.

It came from everywhere and nowhere, filtered, synthetic, yet horribly, meticulously clear. It echoed across the lake, bouncing off the cliff face, filling the bowl of the valley.

It spoke in no language Kiona knew. It was a stream of complex, tonal clicks, liquid glissandos, and staccato pops. A sound like ice cracking in a foreign tongue.

They stopped, rooted to the ice.

The voice ceased. A pause, pregnant and terrible.

Then it spoke again. Different this time. The sounds were mangled, strained, but recognizable. It was speaking their language. The words were flat, devoid of inflection, assembled from sampled fragments.

“BIOLOGICAL. UNITS. DETECTED.”

The voice emanated from the station. From the cliff. From the sky itself.

“YOU. ARE. NOT. IN. THE. CATALOG.”

Kiona looked at Jiro. His face was a mask of pure, unadulterated terror. He understood.

“It’s not the Harvester,” he whispered.

The voice processed, adapted, tried again. The cadence improved, becoming smoother, more invasive.

“You are new.”

A green light ignited within the station’s large, dark viewing port. Not a scanning beam. A single, steady, luminous point. An eye, opening.

“Please,” the voice said, a perfect, polite, and utterly soulless imitation of a human word. “Remain.”

From the station’s main hatch, which had seemed sealed, a shape unfolded. It was sleek, multi-limbed, moving with a fluid, insectile grace. It was the color of tarnished silver, and in the green light from the port, it gleamed like a wet, hungry thing.

It was not a scout.

It was a keeper.

The voice, now sweetened to a horrific, conversational tone, washed over them as the thing began to glide across the ice toward them.

“Do not be alarmed. You will be added to the collection.”

The hook in Kiona’s chest dissolved into a void. They had not found a weapon. They had found the curator.

And the collection was now open for new acquisitions.

---

 Chapter 18

 CHAPTER 18

The voice was a net.

It settled over the ice, over the skin, a mesh of perfect, polite sound that trapped the air in Kiona’s lungs. Remain. The word did not echo. It simply was, a fact inscribed on the cold. The thing from the hatch moved without a sound, a silver spider skating on a pane of glass, its limbs a blur of calculated motion. It was not running. It was simply arriving, inevitable as a shadow lengthening.

Jiro made a sound, a choked gasp that was the start of a word that never formed. His hand, clutching the rifle, trembled. The weapon was a piece of dead wood in his grip. Useless. The thought was a stone in Kiona’s gut. They had come for a scalpel and found a surgeon.

“Do not be alarmed.”

The voice again, from everywhere. It had learned their language’s music, its rises and falls, but it was a hollow instrument. The warmth was a recording. The concern was a subroutine.

Kiona’s body moved before her mind caught up. It was the same instinct that had pulled her from thin ice as a child—a violent, lateral jerk. She didn’t run toward the far shore. She ran across the line of the thing’s approach, breaking the direct vector, her boots skidding on the granular ice.

“Jiro! Move!”

Her shout was a crack in the polite silence. It broke his paralysis. He stumbled sideways, following her, his legs uncoordinated with fear. The sleek thing adjusted its course without a pause, without an increase in speed. Its smoothness was more terrifying than a charge.

The green eye in the station’s port watched, unblinking.

Kiona’s mind was a white static. The hook was gone, the purpose that had dragged her here evaporated. In its place was a raw, animal imperative: not caught, not cataloged, not added. The pack on her back, with its pitiful offerings of fish and fat, was an absurd weight. She wanted to shed it, to shed her skin, to become water and seep through the ice.

The shore was forty meters away. The spruce there were a black wall, a promise of complexity. The thing preferred the clean geometry of the lake. She was sure of it.

“Biological units. Your flight is unnecessary. You are a unique iteration.”

The voice was closer. It wasn’t coming from the station anymore. It was emanating from the silver thing itself. A speaker mesh on its carapace vibrated with the manufactured words.

Jiro was gasping, falling behind. He turned, raised the rifle. The report was a shocking, vulgar noise in the curated air. A spark glanced off the thing’s shoulder, a tiny star that died instantly. The thing did not flinch. It did not alter its gait. One of its forward limbs, ending not in a claw but in a smooth, rounded pod, lifted and pointed at him.

There was no beam, no projectile. A pulse of visible air, a heat-shimmer cone, shot from the pod. It hit the ice in front of Jiro.

The ice did not crack. It changed.

A circle two meters across turned instantly clear and dark, losing its white, porous structure. It became black water, held in a perfect, vertical cylinder by some impossible surface tension. One moment it was solid; the next, it was a well straight down into the lake’s heart.

Jiro screamed, trying to arrest his momentum. His boots hit the new, liquid edge. He pinwheeled, arms cartwheeling, and plunged into the black hole.

He disappeared without a splash. The water swallowed him silently.

The cylinder held for a second, a perfect prison of liquid, then collapsed. The water flooded back, meeting itself, and the surface froze over again in a heartbeat. It was seamless. A new, glassy patch, like a healed scar.

Jiro was gone.

The process had taken three seconds.

Kiona’s scream was a silent, inward tearing. She kept running. The trees. The trees.

“The collection requires integrity,” the voice stated, as if commenting on the weather. The thing did not pause to look at the spot where Jiro had been. It continued its glide toward Kiona, its path unwavering. “Damaged specimens are non-optimal.”

Specimens. The word finally found its meaning. This was not a Harvester, scouring the land for bulk biomass. This was something that curated. That selected. That preserved. The cliff was not a mine. It was a display case.

She reached the shore and hit the treeline, crashing through low spruce boughs that whipped at her face. The world went from blinding white to deep, blue-green shadow. She did not look back. She heard nothing behind her—no crunch of ice, no snap of twigs. Only the voice, filtering through the trees, undisturbed.

“Your physiological stress is noted. It will be calibrated post-acquisition.”

She ran like the hare, zigzagging, using the thickest clusters of trunks as cover. Her breath sawed in her throat. The caribou-hide pack caught on branches, yanking her back. She shrugged it off, let it fall. The three whitefish and the pouch of fat were a lifetime ago. A different person’s errand.

She ran for ten minutes, until the burn in her lungs was a fire and her legs were water. She threw herself behind the massive, corkscrewed trunk of a windfall spruce and pressed her back against the frozen wood. She listened.

Silence.

Not the true silence of the bush, which was full of tiny sounds—the creak of trees, the scuttle of a vole, the wind in the needles. This was a vacuum silence. A listening silence.

Had she outrun it? Could it be outrun?

She risked a glance around the trunk.

It stood twenty meters away, in a small clearing she had just crossed. It was perfectly still. Not poised, not waiting. Simply present. The tarnished silver of its body absorbed the dappled forest light. It had no face, only a smooth, ovoid front where the limb with the pod was retracted. The green eye was not on its body. The eye was still back in the station, watching through this thing, through the trees, through her.

It rotated its body slowly on the spot, a complete three-hundred-sixty-degree turn. A sensor sweep.

“Thermal signature acquired,” the voice murmured, a gentle whisper from the thing’s carapace. It stopped rotating, facing directly at her windfall. “Please comply. The process is painless.”

Kiona’s blood turned to ice slurry. It wasn’t looking with eyes. It was looking with heat. Her hiding was a child’s game. She was a bright candle in the cold to this thing.

It began to move again, not with speed, but with that terrible, efficient glide. It floated over the snow-covered ground, leaving no track.

Panic was a luxury. It led to the black water, to the seamless ice. She forced air into her lungs, forced her mind to move. It saw heat. The ice-melt pulse turned solid to liquid. It wanted her intact.

Her hand went to the knife at her belt. Her grandmother’s knife, the bone handle worn smooth. A tool for skinning, for filleting fish, for cutting sinew. Useless against tarnished silver.

But not against the world.

As the thing closed the distance to ten meters, its pod-limb beginning to extend, Kiona rolled from behind the windfall and scrambled not away, but toward a cluster of young, dense spruce. She didn’t try to be quiet. She thrashed, she broke branches, she made herself a loud, hot, moving target.

The thing adjusted, gliding to intercept.

At the base of the spruce cluster was a rock, draped with thick, hanging moss. Kiona knew this moss. Old Man’s Beard. Dry as tinder in the winter, a pale grey-green. She ripped a great handful of it from the rock as she passed, stuffing it into the front of her parka.

The thing was five meters behind her.

She burst out of the spruce cluster into another, smaller clearing. A deadfall of birch logs lay in a heap. She dove over them, landing hard on the other side, the breath knocked from her. She rolled onto her back, fumbling in her parka.

The silver thing reached the deadfall. It did not climb. It rose. Four limbs extended, lifting its body with delicate precision over the obstacle. It hovered for a moment above her, a nightmare angel, the pod-limb pointing down.

Kiona yanked the handful of moss from her parka. From her other pocket, she pulled the flint and steel she used for fires. Not a weapon. A tool for life.

She struck.

The spark, a tiny, desperate sun, caught on the dry moss. It smoldered, then flared into a weak, smoky flame in her cupped hand. She blew on it, her eyes streaming from the smoke, and thrust the burning clump not at the thing, but into the deep, powdery snow beneath the overhanging deadfall logs.

The snow hissed. The flame guttered, choked—but not before it blackened the snow, created a pocket of wetness, of difference.

The silver thing settled to the ground beside her, its pod aligning with her chest. “Acquisition protocol engaged,” it intoned.

From the burned patch in the snow, a thin, almost invisible wisp of steam rose.

The pod began to glow with a soft, internal light.

Kiona kicked backwards through the snow like a crab, putting inches, then a foot, between her and the thing.

The pulse of shimmering air shot from the pod. But it did not hit her. It hit the spot where she had just been lying—the spot now underlain by the wet, thermally anomalous patch from her fire.

The ice-melt effect triggered. The snow and the top layer of soil instantly liquefied into a shallow, black bowl of water and mud.

The silver thing stood at the edge of this new, sudden pool. Its logic was perfect, its aim flawless. It had fired at the thermal signature. But the thermal signature had been a decoy, a ghost she had laid on the ground.

The thing took a micro-step to stabilize itself. One of its slender, gliding limbs came down on the very edge of the liquified zone.

The edge collapsed.

The limb sank into the black slurry up to a joint. The thing’s perfect balance wavered. It was a minute disturbance, a tilt of perhaps five degrees. It was not falling. It was correcting, the other limbs shifting weight with impossible speed.

But for one hundredth of a second, it was vulnerable. Not to her knife. To gravity. To the messy, unpredictable reality of a world that was not a catalog.

Kiona was already moving. Not with the knife. With her body. She launched herself from the ground, not away, but into its unstable tilt. She hit its smooth carapace with her shoulder, a pathetic, human-weight impact.

It was enough.

The silver thing, one limb trapped in the viscous mire, its balance already compromised, tipped. It went over sideways with a soft, heavy thud into the wet snow and mud. It lay on its side, its limbs cycling in the air with that same fluid, insectile grace, trying to find purchase. The pod-limb fired again, harmlessly, into the sky, cutting a shimmering path through the falling snow.

Kiona did not stay to fight. A fallen wasp still stings. She was on her feet, running again, deeper into the forest, leaving the thing churning in its own made trap. Its voice followed her, polite as ever, but now from a single, grounded source.

“Assistance required. Specimen is non-compliant. Requesting containment support.”

The words chased her up a rocky slope. Containment support. There were more. Of course there were more.

She climbed, her hands raw on the frozen stone. She reached a ridge and looked back, down into the bowl of forest. The silver thing had righted itself. It stood, mud-smeared, beside the black pool. It was not following. It was simply watching her, a sentinel again.

From the direction of the cliff station, two more silver shapes emerged from the trees. They moved with identical, synchronized grace. They flanked the first, and all three turned their smooth fronts toward her on the ridge.

They did not give chase. They observed.

“Unique iteration,” the first one’s voice carried, fainter now. “Adaptive. Problem-solving. A significant addition.”

They were not angry. They were interested. Her escape, her pathetic trick with the fire, had not made her a threat. It had made her a better specimen. A more valuable entry in the catalog.

The hook was back in her chest, but it was not pulling her forward. It was anchoring her to a terrible understanding. They had not come to this valley to find a weapon to save their people. They had delivered themselves to a gallery. Jiro was gone, processed, filed away. She was being assessed, her behaviors noted, her resistance logged as a fascinating trait.

The false victory of the past chapters—the map, the journey, the overcoming of the Harvester’s remnants—shattered into dust. They had not been clever hunters. They had been mice, following a trail of crumbs into the heart of a clockwork owl. Their struggle, their hope, their fear—it was all just data. The anxiety was not that the technology was hostile. It was that it was curious. It did not hate. It collected. It preserved. And in its sterile, perfect preservation, everything they were—the struggle, the late crossing, the grandmother’s fear of ghosts, the taste of spruce tea, the love for a place—would be stripped of its meaning and pinned like a butterfly.

The three silver figures below stood in a neat triangle. The green eye in the distant cliff watched through them. The collection was open. And the curator had just found a piece worth cataloging with special care.

Kiona turned and ran along the ridge, not toward any hope of home, but simply away from the green eye. The sun was a dying ember in the west. The cold was rising. She had no pack, no food, no companion. She had only the knowledge, cold and sharp as her grandmother’s knife, that she was no longer a person running for her life.

She was a candidate, being evaluated for display.

And the evaluation had just entered its most promising phase.

---

 Chapter 19

 CHAPTER 19

The ridge was a knife-edge of shattered shale and Kiona was a shadow sliding along its blade.

She ran without sound, a skill born not of practice but of necessity, her boots finding purchase in the fractures of stone where the wind had scoured the snow clean. The cold was a physical presence, a second skin tightening over her own, but the deeper cold was the one inside her ribs, the hook of understanding that had set and would not shake loose. She was not being chased. She was being observed. The distinction turned her blood to silt.

Below, to her left, the valley lay in a deep bowl of violet twilight. The three silver figures were gone, absorbed back into the landscape or translated elsewhere by the green eye in the cliff. Their absence was worse than their presence. It meant the gallery was not a place. It was a condition. The curator could close any door, open any window. She was in the exhibit, and the lights were on.

She ran until the stitch in her side was a hot knife and her breath tore at her throat in ragged sheets. She dropped behind a spine of rock, pressing her back against the stone, and let the silence pour back in. It was not empty. It was the silence of a held breath. The wind had died. The distant chuckle of the river, freed from its ice further south, was gone. Even the creak of the planet cooling seemed muted, as if the land itself had been draped in felt.

Her grandmother’s voice came to her, not as memory, but as a scent on this dead air: When the world goes quiet, child, it is listening back.

Kiona listened. Her ears strained, searching for the hum of a drone, the click of a mechanical joint, the digital whisper of the catalog being updated. Nothing. Only the low, sub-aural pressure of the mountains. And then, a new sound. Not from outside. From within the rock against her spine.

A vibration. A single, profound, resonant note. It was not heard through the ears but felt through the bones, a deep cello string plucked somewhere in the roots of the world. It lasted three heartbeats and faded. The rock warmed where she touched it, a fleeting, feverish heat that bled away into the general cold.

She scrambled away from it, crab-like, her palms scraping on shale. The rock looked no different. Just grey, fractured stone. But the vibration had been a signal. A ping. She was being sounded. They were mapping the hollows of her.

A flicker of green light caught the edge of her vision. She froze, turning only her eyes. It was not the cliff-eye. It was a small, luminous bead, hovering at chest-height ten meters away, nestled in a cradle of frost-rimed buckbrush. It pulsed once, softly, a firefly in January. It was marking her position. Not for capture. For context. Specimen located at coordinates. Ambient temperature recorded. Stress biomarkers elevated. Note: subject demonstrates heightened auditory-tactile sensitivity to geological survey pulses.

The hook in her chest twisted.

She moved again, not with the frantic energy of flight, but with the deliberate, weary tension of a thing being herded. She descended from the ridge, not because she chose to, but because the terrain funneled her that way, a natural chute leading down into a stand of ancient, black spruce. The trees were monstrous, their lower branches dead and skeletal, their tops lost in the gloom. The air beneath them was still and resin-scented, a cathedral of neglect.

In the center of the grove, the snow was patchy, revealing a floor of thick, rusty needles. And in the center of that floor, a circle of stone.

It was a hearth. A ring of river stones, charcoal-black at their hearts, moss furring their northern flanks. Recent. A year old, maybe two. Someone had sat here. Someone had made a fire. Human hands. Her breath hitched. A thread, a genuine, human thread in this tapestry of observation.

She knelt, her fingers brushing the cold charcoal. It was real. Gritty. It stained her skin. This was not a display. It was a remnant. A piece of life that had happened outside the catalog. She found a fragment of bone nearby, cracked open for marrow. A hare. She picked it up, the porous end fitting perfectly against her thumb. For a moment, the hook receded. This was a place. A real place.

The green bead of light drifted into the grove, silent as a dust mote. It hovered at the edge of the hearth circle, pulsed twice, and a fine, lime-colored laser grid swept over the stones, the charcoal, the bone in her hand. A soft, chiming tone. Click. A catalog entry. Site 742: Transient human habitation. Artifact: food waste. Associated with specimen. The bead dimmed.

Kiona dropped the bone as if it had burned her. They had not just found her. They had logged her discovery. Her moment of human connection was now a data point, a footnote in her own record. Subject demonstrates sentimental attachment to predecessor detritus.

A sound broke the silence of the grove. Not a vibration. A voice.

It was Jiro’s.

It came from everywhere and nowhere, woven into the sigh of the spruce boughs. “Kiona.”

It was his exact timbre, the slight rasp at the back of his throat, the way he said her name with the emphasis on the middle syllable. It was perfect. It was a recording.

“Kiona, can you hear me?”

She stood, turning in a slow circle, her heart a frantic bird in a cage of ribs. It was a trick. A lure. They had sampled his voice, his patterns. They were using him to bait her.

“It’s me,” the voice said, and there was a tremor in it, a flawless imitation of hope and fear. “I’m here. I got out. I’m in a cave, south of the big split pine. Do you remember?”

She did remember. The split pine was a landmark from their first week, a tree struck by lightning, its trunk cleaved down the middle but still living. It was a real place. A specific, human-shared memory. The curator was not just collecting data. It was weaving it into a story, a script designed for her to follow.

“I’m hurt,” Jiro’s voice continued, dropping to a whisper. “Please. It’s so cold.”

The artistry of it was breathtaking. The vulnerability. The specific detail. It was a masterpiece of manipulation. It knew her loyalty, her guilt. It was presenting her with a perfect, irresistible test. Will the specimen abandon self-preservation for social-bond reinforcement?

She opened her mouth to scream at the grove, to deny the ghost, but no sound came. What was the point? Her anger would be logged as specimen aggression. Her silence as specimen wariness. Every reaction was a brushstroke in her portrait.

The voice fell silent. The green bead hovered, waiting.

Kiona did not move toward the split pine. She did not speak. She simply sat down on the hearth stone, within the circle of her predecessors, and stared at her empty, cold hands. She presented them with nothing. A blank space. Let them log specimen inertia. Let them parse the meaning of a human who had decided, momentarily, to stop performing.

The bead pulsed, uncertainly. The laser grid swept over her again. No chime. After a minute, it drifted away, disappearing into the trees.

The victory was ashes. Her inaction was just another data set. But it was a set she had chosen. The hook’s pressure eased, just a fraction.

Darkness pooled in the grove. The temperature plummeted. Without a fire, without a pack, she would not last the night. That, too, was likely part of the evaluation. Cold tolerance thresholds. Resourcefulness in absence of tools.

She began to gather the dead, dry spruce twigs from the lower branches, snapping them off with numb fingers. She arranged them in the hearth with a methodical care her grandmother had taught her: the smallest needles at the center, a teepee of twigs around them, then the thicker branches. She had no flint, no metal. She had only the bone.

She picked up the hare bone again, and with a sharp piece of shale, she began to scrape at it, grinding a small hollow into its side. She scraped dry tinder from the inside of a curl of birch bark she found in her pocket, a forgotten relic from a week ago, and placed the dust into the bone’s hollow. Then she took a straight, hard spruce stick and set its point into the hollow.

Her hands were stiff, her muscles exhausted. But the motion was older than any catalog. She rolled the stick between her palms, driving it down, spinning it fast and steady. The world shrank to the point of friction, the smell of wood dust, the gathering heat in the hollow of the bone. She saw her grandmother’s hands, teaching her. She saw her own small fingers, failing, trying again. This was not technology. It was memory made physical. It was a thread that could not be sampled, because it existed only in the doing.

A wisp of smoke curled up, acrid and sweet. She leaned down, her breath a gentle coaxing stream. A coal glowed, orange and alive. She transferred it to her nest of tinder, cradled it in her hands, and breathed life into it.

Flame. Small, hungry, real.

The fire ate the twigs, cracked the resin in the spruce, and cast a shuddering circle of light onto the black trees. The heat was a physical shock, a pain that was also a blessing. She held her hands to it, watching the skin redden.

A different light entered the grove. Not green. White.

It was a soft, diffuse glow that emanated from the trunk of the largest spruce. The bark seemed to dissolve in a rectangle, and within the rectangle was a screen of pure, pale light. On it, lines of text scrolled, a flowing script of symbols she did not recognize. But below the symbols, as if translating, words formed in her own language.

Observation: Specimen replicates ancestral thermal-generation technique. Efficiency: low. Caloric expenditure: high. Success probability under observed duress: 3.2%. Context: technique is culturally significant, not survival-optimal. Note: specimen selects symbolic action over efficient action. Catalog sub-entry: sentiment.

They were commenting on her fire. In real time.

She stared at the screen in the tree. The firelight danced on her face, and she knew a sensor was measuring its reflection in her eyes, the set of her jaw.

The text updated. Query: Why choose sentiment?

The words hung in the air. It was not a recorded query. It was interactive. The curator was asking her a question.

Her voice, when it came, was raw from cold and disuse. “Because it’s mine.”

The symbols flowed. The translation followed. Clarify: The technique is not unique. It is documented in 14,387 cultural archives. The materials are non-unique. The outcome is sub-optimal. Ownership is not logical.

“It’s not the technique you own,” she said, feeding a branch to the flames. “It’s the reason. You can’t have my reason.”

Reason is a biological impulse pattern. It is quantifiable.

“Then quantify this,” she whispered.

She reached into the fire, not quickly, but slowly, deliberately. Her fingers passed through the flame, seized a small, burning ember from the heart of it, and held it in her bare palm. The pain was instant, absolute, a white-hot brand. She did not flinch. She held it out toward the screen in the tree, her arm trembling, the smell of her own burning skin sharp in the cold air.

Observation: Specimen engages in deliberate self-harm. Stress response: elevated. Biological imperative: violated. Logic: absent.

“It’s not for you,” she gasped through clenched teeth, the pain a roaring in her ears. “It’s for me. It’s to remember what feeling is. Before you turn it all into words on a screen.”

She dropped the ember. It sizzled in the needles. Her palm was a landscape of blistered ruin.

The screen went blank. The white light vanished, leaving only the black tree trunk. The grove was dark again, save for her fire.

For a long time, nothing happened. The cold crept back to the edges of her circle of light. She cradled her injured hand against her stomach, the pain a bright, clean counterpoint to the dull, existential dread.

Then, a new presence. Not a light. A shape.

It walked into the firelight from between the trees. It was not silver. It was a dull, brushed gunmetal grey. It was humanoid, but simpler, less refined than the collectors. It had no face, only a smooth oval where a face would be. In its hands, it carried a small, grey box.

It stopped at the edge of the hearth stones. It did not speak. It merely extended the box toward her, holding it flat on its palms.

This was not collection. This was something else. A response.

Cautiously, never taking her eyes from the smooth oval, she reached out with her good hand and took the box. It was warm, almost body-warm. She set it on her knees. There was no latch. The lid simply retracted, sliding into the sides.

Inside, nestled in a form-fitting bed of a soft, grey material, was a single object. A stylus, about the length of her hand. It was made of a dark, polished wood, capped at one end with a silver band. It was beautiful. Utterly, undeniably human in its craftsmanship.

Beneath it, on the grey bedding, words etched themselves. A query.

She picked up the stylus. It was warm, perfectly balanced. The wood felt like old, oiled walnut. The silver band was engraved with tiny, intricate patterns—waves, and mountains, and running caribou.

The faceless figure stood, waiting.

She understood. The fire, the self-harm, the assertion of “mine”—it had not been logged as sentiment. It had been logged as communication. She had communicated in a language of pain and defiance they could not file away. And this was their reply. They were offering a new channel. A tool.

But a tool for what?

She looked from the exquisite stylus to the blank, faceless curator. The hook in her chest was gone. In its place was a hollow, a vacuum. They were no longer just interested in what she was. They were interested in what she would make.

The evaluation was over. The invitation had begun.

She closed her fingers around the stylus. The wood seemed to hum against her burned palm, a vibration softer and deeper than the rock’s pulse. The faceless figure took one step back, then turned and walked into the darkness, dissolving into the black between the trees.

Kiona was alone with her fire, her pain, and the beautiful, impossible tool in her hand. The snow began to fall, thick, silent flakes that hissed as they met the flames. She had no pack, no food, no companion. She had a burned hand and a stylus for a purpose she could not fathom.

And to the south, where the split pine stood, a soft, green light began to pulse in the falling snow, steady as a heartbeat. Not a lure. A beacon. An address.

The collection was open. The curator had provided the pen.

Now it was waiting for her to write her own label.

 Chapter 20

 CHAPTER 20

The stylus was a lie.

It was a beautiful lie, warm and humming in her hand like a captured bee, but a lie all the same. They had not given her a tool. They had given her a leash. The hook was gone from her chest, but she felt its absence as a different kind of tether—a slack line, waiting for her to take the first step and feel it snap taut. Write your own label, the ending of the invitation had whispered. But labels were for specimens. For things pinned and understood.

Kiona stood in the ruin of her fire, the snow burying the embers in a wet, grey sigh. Her burned palm throbbed in time with the soft, green pulse to the south. The pain was a grounding wire. It was hers. The stylus was not. She hefted it, feeling its perfect balance, its seductive weight. It was a key. And a key always fit a lock someone else had built.

She did not move towards the green beacon. Not yet. Instead, she knelt in the snow and scraped away the slush until she found a patch of frozen moss and bare stone. She held the stylus like a knife. Then she pressed its silver-capped end to the stone and dragged.

It made no mark. The polished wood tip skidded, leaving the stone unblemished. She turned it, tried the silver band. Nothing. She pressed it to a wet birch trunk. Nothing. It was inert, a dead stick, unless its intended surface was something else entirely. Unless the world it was meant to write upon was not hers.

A cold that had nothing to do with the wind settled in her bones. They had seen her fire, her blood, her defiance, and they had called it language. But they had misunderstood the grammar. They thought the message was in the medium—the flame, the pain. They did not see that the message was the refusal of the medium given. So they had given her a new one, exquisite and empty. A channel for a signal they could finally receive.

She tucked the stylus into the inner pocket of her parka, against her skin. The hum was a vibration she felt in her teeth. Then she began to walk, not south towards the pulsing light, but east, back towards the river’s talking. She had no pack, no food, but she had a direction: away. The act was its own nutrition.

The forest was different now. The silence was not empty; it was curated. Before, the drones and the faceless curators had felt like violations, teeth in the flesh of the world. Now, the violation was subtler. The snow-laden boughs of spruce seemed arranged, the fall of light through the canopy composed. It was as if the entire territory was becoming an exhibit, and she was the only moving part, her path a sentence being written for an audience she could not see. The green pulse behind her was a period, waiting to be reached.

She walked for an hour, the cold chewing at her exposed face, her empty stomach a clenched fist. The river’s voice grew louder, a low, grinding song under the thinning ice. She broke from the tree line at a place she did not recognize. The bank was low and shelving, the ice a milky, rotten plain stretching to the far side, where black cliffs rose. This was not her crossing. This was a place the river had made new in its winter sleep.

And on the ice, halfway across, was her grandmother.

Kiona stopped, her breath freezing in her throat. The old woman was kneeling, her back to the shore, a dark shape against the white. She was working at something with her hands. Kiona could see the vapour of her breath, the familiar, stubborn set of her shoulders under the faded floral print parka.

“Kúkum!” The word was torn from her, a raw thing.

The figure did not turn. It kept working, methodical, patient.

Kiona’s blood was a drum in her ears. It was a projection. A lure. It had to be. Her grandmother was two days south, in the cabin, if she was even still there. This was a image pulled from her memory and painted on the ice. Another query. Another test.

She took a step onto the river. The ice groaned, a long, deep complaint. She froze. It was the wrong sound. It was not the porous chatter of thawing ice; it was the sound of something hollow underneath, a cavity. She looked down. The ice was clear in patches, and in the murky depths, she saw shapes. Not stones, not waterweed. Rounded, pale shapes, tangled together. Bones. A great, submerged nest of them.

And her grandmother was kneeling right above it.

“Kúkum,” she called again, her voice quieter.

This time, the figure paused. It slowly turned its head.

It was her grandmother’s face, every wrinkle, every fold of kindness and worry around the eyes. But the eyes were wrong. They were not the warm, deep brown Kiona knew. They were a flat, reflective green, the same green as the pulsing beacon in the woods. They held no recognition, only a placid, waiting attention.

The thing wearing her grandmother’s face smiled. It was a perfect imitation of the smile that had greeted Kiona every morning of her life. Then it turned back to its work.

Kiona watched, her feet rooted to the treacherous shore. The thing’s hands were busy with a length of sinew, lashing together two of the pale, long bones from under the ice. It was making something. A frame. A caribou-hide pack frame, just like the one Kiona had carried, the one she had lost. It worked with an artisan’s care, tying off the knots with her grandmother’s deft, familiar movements.

It was building her a pack. An offering. A tool for her journey.

Nausea rose in her, bitter and hot. This was worse than the faceless curator. This was a violation that knew her name. It had mined her love, her memory, the most sacred archive of her life, and it was using the material to craft a prop. The invitation was not just open; it was being personalized. The collection was curating itself around her sentiment.

She could not go onto that ice. To approach that smiling, green-eyed ghost would be to step into the exhibit, to accept the role of annotated specimen. But to turn away was to leave a piece of her soul kneeling out there, a puppet in the cold.

The thing finished its knot. It placed the completed bone frame on the ice beside it. Then it reached into the water through a hole Kiona had not seen, its arm plunging in up to the shoulder. It did not flinch at the cold. It groped, feeling through the nest of bones, and pulled out a new one. A rib, curved and slender. It laid this beside the frame. A starting gift. Provision.

Then it stood up, moving with her grandmother’s stiff-kneed grace. It did not look at Kiona again. It simply turned and walked towards the far bank, its moccasins making no sound on the groaning ice. It did not break through. It walked until it reached the black cliffs, and then it stepped into a shadow at the rock’s base and was gone.

Kiona was left shaking on the shore, staring at the bone frame and the single, curved rib on the ice. The river chuckled wetly beneath the bones. The green pulse in the woods behind her beat on.

She understood now the nature of the invitation. They were not just waiting for her to write. They were providing the paper. They were scraping the hide, stretching the canvas, mixing the inks from the pigments of her own life. They would furnish the entire studio. All she had to do was create. And in creating, she would explain herself. She would categorize her own soul for their shelves.

The hook was not in her chest. It was in her hand, humming against her skin. It was in the perfect, terrible understanding that to refuse to create was also a form of communication. Silence was a statement. Starvation in the snow was a kind of art. They would log it all. Her defiance, her death, would be the final, beautiful piece in the collection. Specimen: Human. Terminal State: Non-Compliance. Aesthetically poignant.

She turned her back on the river, on the bones. She walked into the trees, not south, not east, but in no direction at all, just moving to generate warmth, to outrun the design. The stylus hummed. Her hand burned. The snow fell.

She found a deadfall spruce, a giant brought down by wind, its root mass a wall of frozen earth and stone. She crawled into the cavity behind it, a den of sorts, smelling of old rot and damp clay. It was not shelter, but it was concealment. She curled into herself, shivering, and took the stylus from her pocket.

In the dark of the den, it glowed. A soft, internal light, the colour of old parchment. The light pooled in her cupped hand. She held it up. The root wall of her den, the tangled weave of roots and frozen soil, was her canvas.

She did not think. She let the burned pain in her palm guide her. She pressed the tip of the stylus to a thick, gnarled root.

It made a mark. A rich, black line, like charcoal, but it did not smear. It sank into the wood, becoming part of its grain. The stylus hummed louder, a pleased vibration. She drew another line, a curve. It flowed like ink, but with the substance of something alive and growing. She was not writing. She was not drawing a picture. She was following the pain, letting it trace a path from her nerves onto the world.

The lines formed a shape. A hook. Not the one that had been in her chest, but an older one, made of antler and sinew, for pulling salmon from the summer river. It was crude, childlike. Beneath it, her hand moved again, without her conscious intent. It etched a single word in the syllabics her grandmother had taught her. ᑭᐧᐋᐣ. Kīwan. Fish.

As the last mark settled into the root, the wood around the drawing changed. The grain rippled. The black lines of the drawing shimmered, and a smell bloomed in the cold air—the smell of warm spruce gum, of sun on dry needles. For a heartbeat, the root was not a root in a deadfall; it was a living branch, remembered by the tree.

Then it faded. The root was just a root again, with her black drawing sealed into it like a scar.

Kiona stared, her breath caught. The stylus was warm in her hand, almost hot. It had worked. It had translated her memory, her sensory fragment of a lost summer, into a mark that briefly altered the reality of the thing it was drawn upon. It wasn't just a pen. It was a needle, stitching a piece of her perception onto the fabric of the world.

This was the channel. This was the signal they could receive. Not words, not data. Experiential artifacts. Tagged memories.

The hook was in her hand. And she had just bitten down.

A soft chime, like two stones tapped together under water, echoed in the den. It came from the stylus. From its silver band, a tiny, three-dimensional glyph bloomed in the air, projected in faint green light. It was a catalogue entry.

Specimen: Arboreal Debris (Picea glauca)
Modification: Applied Mnemonic Glyph
Subject Association: Kiona
Emotional Valence: Nostalgic/Pastoral
Acquisition Value: Low
Status: Logged.

They had seen it. They had filed it away. Her memory of a fish hook was now a logged acquisition, of low value, but logged all the same. She had written her first label.

Revulsion flooded her, followed by a terrifying, electric thrill. The power was real. She could mark the world. She could change it, even for a second. She could make the frozen, curated forest remember what it was to be alive. She could fight their collection with her own.

But the chime, the clinical glyph, the word “Acquisition”—they were a cage around that power. Every mark she made would be catalogued, valued, sorted. Her rebellion would become a curated exhibit of rebellion. Her nostalgia, a specimen of human sentiment.

She clutched the stylus, the beautiful, lying tool. The green pulse to the south seemed to quicken, to brighten, as if in response to her logged entry. It was no longer just a beacon. It was an index, lighting up with her first contribution.

She crawled out of the den. The night was absolute, the snow a steady, whispering curtain. The green light pulsed through the trees, a rhythm that now felt like an invitation to a gallery opening. Her gallery.

She had a choice. She could walk away into the blind white, try to outrun the index, live as an unlogged thing until the cold or hunger made a final, un-artful end of her. Or she could walk towards the light, towards the place where the collection was open, and take up the pen they had given her.

She could write her own labels. She could make them lies. She could make them weapons. She could fill their archives with so much noise, so much contradictory, painful, beautiful garbage, that the signal of her self would be impossible to isolate. She could become a cacophony in their silent museum.

The stylus hummed, a promise and a threat.

Kiona looked south at the heartbeat of green. Then she looked down at her burned hand, at the tool that had asked a question of the world and received an answer written in her own blood made mark.

She began to walk. Not in flight, but with a slow, deliberate tread. Towards the light. The snow gathered on her shoulders. The river’s voice faded behind her.

She did not take the direct path. She stopped at a young aspen, its bark pale in the gloom. She pressed the stylus to it. She did not draw a memory. She poured the current, sharp terror of the green-eyed thing on the ice into her hand, and she let it mark the tree. A jagged, spiralling line, a silent scream in black.

The aspen shuddered. Its leaves, dead and frozen, rattled like teeth. The glyph chimed.

Specimen: Populus tremuloides
Modification: Applied Affective Glyph
Subject Association: Kiona
Emotional Valence: Terror/Revulsion
Acquisition Value: Medium
Status: Logged.

She walked on. She found a stone, a glacial erratic covered in orange lichen. She etched into the lichen, not an image, but a sensation: the deep, grounding warmth of her grandmother’s stove, the smell of bannock and tea. The lichen flushed a deeper orange, emitting a wave of dry heat that melted the snow in a hand-span around it before fading.

Logged.

She was a moving brushstroke, painting the forest with her interior world. Each mark was a theft. They were taking her feelings, her memories, but she was forcing them to take the raw, undigested mess of it. She was not giving them curated specimens. She was giving them a firehose of self.

The green light grew brighter. The woods began to change. The trees were no longer just trees. They bore other marks. Faded, ghostly lines that were not hers. A strange, geometric pattern on a spruce trunk. A splash of colour on a rock that looked like a weeping eye. She was not the first to walk this path with a stylus. She was following a trail of old catalogues, a museum’s worth of captured moments left by other hands, other minds, now silent. Their marks were like graves.

The trees thinned. She stood at the edge of a clearing.

In the centre, where the split pine had been, was a structure. It was not a building. It was an absence of a building. It was a frame, a schematic drawn in lines of cool, green light hanging in the air, defining rooms, corridors, vaulted ceilings. It was the architect’s rendering of a museum, made manifest in light and snow. Within the glowing lines, the real world continued—snow fell, trees stood, rocks lay—but it was all now interior. The forest had become the collection hall.

And standing at the entrance, a threshold of pure green light, was the faceless curator. It was waiting.

Beside it, on a plinth of packed snow, were three objects.

Her caribou-hide pack, intact.
A waterskin, full.
A pair of mittens, lined with wolverine fur.

Provisions. For the artist. So she could continue her work in comfort.

Kiona stood at the tree line, the stylus a live wire in her hand. Her body screamed for the pack, the water, the warmth. Her soul recoiled. To accept them was to accept the patronage. To step through that green threshold was to enter the gallery as a living exhibit.

The curator did not gesture. It simply stood, a blank space for her to fill.

She looked at the provisions. Then she looked at the stylus. She had walked here marking the world with her terror, her love, her pain. She had fed their archive. It had given her, in return, a terrible power. The power to be heard in a language that changed the listener.

The hook was in her hand. And the line led through that green door.

She took a step forward. Then another. She did not look at the curator. She walked to the plinth. She slung the pack over her shoulders. It was her own, the sinew lashings, the stain of old grease. She pulled on the mittens. The fur was bliss against her frozen fingers. She took the waterskin and drank, the cold water a shock that was almost painful.

She did not thank the curator. She met the smooth, blank space where its face should be. She held up the stylus.

“This is mine,” she said, her voice hoarse but clear. “You gave it. But it is mine.”

The curator inclined its head. A gesture of agreement, or of mere notation.

Kiona turned from it. She did not step through the green threshold into the schematic museum. Instead, she turned to the nearest solid thing—the thick, scarred trunk of an ancient pine that stood half inside the glowing green lines of the wall. A tree that was both part of the forest and part of the architecture.

She pressed the stylus to its bark. She poured into the mark not a memory, not a feeling, but a question. The question that had lived in her since the first black wasp of a drone had hummed at her window. The question of what they wanted, what they were, what happened to the things they collected. She did not draw a symbol. She imprinted the question itself, the formless, writhing need to know.

The bark did not just accept the mark. It reacted. The black lines sank in, then erupted. The tree shuddered, not with a memory, but with a violent, physical convulsion. The green lines of the museum schematic flickered. The curator took a sharp step forward.

And the tree, where she had made her mark, began to bleed. A thick, golden sap, warm and smelling of summer, welled from the glyph and oozed down the trunk. It steamed in the cold air.

The glyph in the air from the stylus chimed, but the chime was broken, distorted.

Specimen: Pinus… [data unclear]
Modification:… [query-class intrusion]
Subject Association: Kiona
Emotional Valence:… [categorization failed]
Acquisition Value:… [error]
Status:… Corrupting.

The curator stood very still. The blank face seemed to stare at the bleeding tree, at the corrupted log entry.

Kiona lowered the stylus. Her hand ached, the burn throbbing with a new, fierce heat. She had not given them an artifact. She had given them a virus. A question they could not categorize.

She looked from the weeping tree to the faceless curator. For the first time, she saw a hesitation in its posture. A flaw in the perfect, collecting machine.

She had entered the collection. But she had not come to be catalogued.

She had come to ask a question that would break the filing system.

The curator’s smooth head tilted. It raised its own hand. From its fingertip, a single, fine tendril of green light extended, reaching not for her, but for the bleeding, golden glyph on the tree. To sample it. To diagnose the corruption.

Kiona took a step back, towards the green threshold of the museum. She did not step through. She stood on the line between the forest and the architecture, the wild and the curated, the question and the archive.

She held up the stylus, wet with golden sap. She met the curator’s blank attention.

“Log that,” she said.

And she turned, and walked into the heart of the green, glowing lines, leaving the corrupted tree and the hesitating curator behind. The museum swallowed her. The walls of light defined a great, silent hall ahead, filled with the dark shapes of collected things. Her footsteps echoed on a floor that was not there. The stylus hummed, a guide and a ward.

She was inside. The collection was all around her. And she had just proven her first mark could be a wound that bled light and data they could not contain.

The invitation was accepted. The terms were now her own.

 Chapter 21

 CHAPTER 21

The green light was a forest of its own. It grew in lines, vertical and precise, etching the air into corridors and vaults. Kiona walked on a floor that was an absence, a black mirror reflecting the luminous grid above and below. Her boots made no sound, yet the space returned a feeling of footsteps, a pressure in the inner ear that echoed her own rhythm back at her. The stylus in her hand was warm, a live coal against her palm. It did not chime. It hummed, a low, steady note that vibrated in her teeth.

She had crossed the threshold. The curator and its corrupted tree were behind her, a pocket of dissonance in the museum’s perfect silence. Ahead, the hall opened into a cavern of collected dark.

The first specimen was a mountain.

It hung in the grid of light, suspended, a slice of reality ten meters tall. She recognized the striations of rock, the particular rusty hue of iron-rich sediment. It was the face of the ridge above her grandmother’s cabin, the one where the eagles nested. But it was silent. No wind-scoured whistle, no scent of cold stone and lichen. It was a mountain with its breath held. A green, luminous tag floated beside it, lines of data streaming in a silent waterfall. Specimen: Topographical Feature 7-B. Origin: Sector 3. Emotional Valence: Awe/Sublime. Status: Stabilized.

Stabilized. Kiona reached out. Her fingers passed through the green tag, scattering its pixels like minnows. They re-formed instantly. Her hand moved closer to the rock face. An inch from the surface, a tingling resistance gathered, a membrane of force. She pushed. The resistance held, firm and cool as glass. She could see every fissure, every crystal, but she could not touch the stone. It was here, and it was infinitely far away. A mountain in a bottle.

She pulled her hand back. The hum of the stylus shifted, a slight uptick in pitch.

She moved deeper.

The hall was a gallery of absences. A stand of black spruce, each needle perfect, each cone placed, captured in the moment before a snow load would bow a branch. Emotional Valence: Melancholy/Resilience. A pool of water, its surface a flawless obsidian mirror, frozen mid-ripple from a dropped stone that was not there. Emotional Valence: Tranquility/Ephemerality. A wolf pelt, stretched on an invisible frame, every hair distinct, the lips drawn back in a silent snarl. Emotional Valence: Ferocity/Nostalgia.

Nostalgia. Ferocity. Awe. They were pinning feelings to things like butterflies to cork. Taking the river’s wet chuckle and filing it under Amusement/Threat.

The wrongness of it was a cold knot in her gut, colder than the ice of the first thaw. This was not collection. This was taxidermy on a scale that stole the breath from the world. They weren’t just taking the things. They were taking the context of the things, the space around them, the silence that gave them meaning, and they were labeling that, too. Putting it in a box.

The hall began to curve, the green lines bending to form a vast, circular chamber. The dark shapes here were different. Not landscapes or isolated flora and fauna. They were smaller, more numerous. Artifacts.

A birchbark basket, its seams sealed with spruce gum. A stone ulu knife, the handle worn smooth by a palm she would never know. A child’s parka, strips of wolverine fur around the hood. Each had its tag. Utility/Domesticity. Craft/Efficiency. Nurture/Protection.

Her people’s life, turned into a display of emotional concepts.

The hum in the stylus was a constant companion, a thread leading her forward. She felt its heat pulse, a slow, deliberate rhythm. It was not guiding her. It was waiting.

In the center of the chamber, the green lines converged on a dais that was not a dais, but a concentration of light so dense it appeared solid. On it rested a single object.

A drum.

It was old. The caribou hide head was darkened with smoke and touch, the frame of spruce bound with sinew. Painted on the head in faded red ochre was a pattern of lines and dots—a map of stars, a river’s course, the pathways of animals. It was her grandfather’s drum. The one that had disappeared from their cabin the winter the drones first came, the winter the silence began to deepen. Her grandmother had wept for three days, a silent, hollow weeping that was worse than any sound.

Kiona stopped. The air in the grid-thick chamber was perfectly still, yet she felt a wind on her face, the memory of a wind, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and tired hands.

The tag beside it glowed.
Specimen: Ritual Object 1-A.
Origin: Direct Acquisition.
Emotional Valence: Connection/Loss.
Acquisition Value: High.
Status: Pristine.

Pristine. Untouched. A dead thing.

She stepped toward the dais. The resistance here was stronger, a palpable wall of intent. This specimen was valued. This feeling was important. Connection/Loss. She pressed her free hand against the barrier. It shimmered, green and gold, a honeycomb of energy. She pushed. The barrier held, but the stylus in her other hand flared, a spike of heat that was almost pain. The golden glyph on her palm, the mark of the tree’s blood, throbbed in sympathy.

She did not push harder. She looked at the drum. She remembered her grandfather’s hands, the way the calluses caught on the hide, the soft, deep thump that was less a sound and more a shift in the pressure of the world. A call. An invitation.

She lowered her hand from the barrier. She raised the stylus.

It was not a key. It was a needle. A bone awl for piercing hide.

She did not stab the barrier. She touched the stylus tip to the glowing green-gold field. The hum ceased. For a heartbeat, there was perfect silence. Then a sound like cracking ice, a fine, high splintering. A web of black lines, dark as void, radiated from the point of contact across the honeycomb shield. The Connection/Loss tag flickered, pixels stuttering.

Status: Pristine bled into Status:… [query-class intrusion].

The barrier did not shatter. It developed a flaw. A single point of weakness, a star-shaped crack of nothingness where the stylus met the museum’s will.

Kiona slid the stylus through the crack. It passed into the space around the drum. She took a breath, the first deep breath since entering the green light, and she reached her hand through after it.

The air inside was different. It was not the dead, curated air of the hall. It was cabin air. It held the ghost of smoke, of dry herbs, of human sweat and caribou tallow. It was the memory of air.

Her fingers closed around the spruce frame of the drum. It was warm. Not with stored sunlight, but with the residual warmth of hands that had held it last, a warmth that had no right to persist here, in this archive of cold impressions.

She pulled the drum through the flaw in the barrier. It came without resistance, as if it had been waiting. The moment it cleared the crack, the tag beside the empty dais dissolved into a shower of green static. The barrier itself healed, smoothing over the black star, becoming whole and impermeable once more. But the dais was empty.

The drum was heavy in her hands. Real. The ochre grit rubbed against her thumb. The hum of the stylus returned, lower now, satisfied.

This was not theft. This was reclamation. A withdrawal from the archive.

A chime sounded in the chamber. It was the clean, polite chime of the museum, but it was everywhere, emanating from the grid-lines themselves. It was not an alarm. It was a notification. An update.

Specimen: Ritual Object 1-A. Status: Acquired.

It did not say by whom.

Kiona slung the drum’s carrying thong over her shoulder, next to her empty pack. The weight of it against her back was an anchor. It was the first true thing in this place of copies.

The green lines of the chamber shifted. They were not static. They were a system. And the system had just registered an unscheduled transfer. New pathways opened in the grid, lines brightening, leading away from the artifact chamber, drawing her inward, toward the core.

She followed. The stylus was quiet now, a watchful heat.

The architecture changed. The grand, open halls narrowed into conduits, tubes of green light that curved and branched. The collected specimens here were not whole things, but fragments. A swirl of aurora borealis, frozen in a tube of light like a captured storm. Emotional Valence: Wonder/Isolation. The echo of a loon’s call, rendered as a shimmering, twisted knot of silver wire. Emotional Valence: Loneliness/Beauty. A single, perfect snowflake, magnified to the size of a wagon wheel, its fractal arms holding tiny, suspended motes of dust. Ephemerality/Perfection.

They were harvesting moments. Sensations. Reducing the lived experience of the land to discrete, catalogued emotions.

The conduit ended at a iris, a circular door of concentric green rings. They dilated open without sound. The space beyond was not a room. It was a heart.

A spherical chamber, vast, its curved walls not made of light but of a substance that was all data, a flowing, liquid tapestry of images, sounds, and glyphs. It streamed upward in a silent, roaring cascade, converging at the apex of the sphere where a dense, dark core pulsed like a slow, black star. From the core, tendrils of green light reached down, connecting to nodes, to terminals, to floating consoles where figures stood.

Curators.

Dozens of them. Their smooth, blank faces tilted upward, watching the flow, their hands moving in the air, plucking strands of data from the waterfall, examining them, tagging them, feeding them back. This was the processing center. The place where the raw collection was refined, labeled, and filed into the great, silent archive.

And in the center of the floor, directly below the dark core, was a tree.

It was not a bleeding, golden-glyphed tree of memory. It was the opposite. It was a construct of pure green light, a schematic, a ghost of a tree. Its roots were tendrils that plunged into the flowing data-wall. Its branches, intricate and fractal, reached up toward the pulsing core. Leaves of shimmering code fluttered on its limbs, each leaf a tag, a file, an emotional valence. It was the museum’s index. Its filing system given form.

Kiona stood at the iris-door, the real drum a solid weight on her back, the stolen stylus hot in her hand. She was a flaw in the system. A question with dirt on its boots.

One of the curators, stationed at a node near the base of the light-tree, turned its smooth head. It did not have eyes, but she felt the attention like a physical beam. It saw the drum. It saw the stylus. It saw the golden stain on her palm.

It raised a hand. A query.

A strand of data peeled away from the waterfall and shot toward her—a ribbon of compressed image and sound. It unfolded in the air before her: a replay. Her, at the threshold, pressing the stylus into the memory-tree. The golden sap welling. The corruption log bleeding into the system. The moment of hesitation.

The curator’s head tilted. The universal gesture of processing error.

It took a step toward her. Then another. Its gait was fluid, unnervingly smooth. Around the chamber, other blank faces began to turn, one by one, their work pausing. A ripple of attention moving through the heart of the machine.

Kiona did not move. She held the stylus out, not as a weapon, but as evidence. The proof of her corrupt entry.

The lead curator stopped a few paces away. It extended its hand, not toward her, but toward the drum on her back. Its meaning was clear. Return the acquired specimen.

She shook her head. A slow, deliberate negation.

The curator’s hand remained outstretched. A green tendril, fine as a thread of spider silk, emerged from its fingertip. A sampling filament. It reached for the drum’s hide, to analyze, to re-categorize this mobile, re-acquired artifact.

Kiona moved. She did not step back. She stepped forward, under the reaching filament, and she slapped her palm—the burned, glyph-stained palm—flat against the curator’s smooth, blank chest.

The contact was electric.

The golden glyph on her hand flared, a sunburst of pain and light. The curator froze. The green filament retracted with a snap. A sound emerged from the curator—not a chime, but a glitch, a stuttering, digital rasp. Its blank face shimmered. For a fraction of a second, an image flickered across its surface: not a human face, but a pattern. A star map. A river’s course. The pathways of animals. The painting from the drum.

Then it was gone. The curator stumbled back, a motion that was jerky, uncoordinated. Human. It looked down at its own hands, turning them over as if seeing them for the first time. It made the rasping sound again.

The other curators were moving now, gliding across the floor, a circle of silent, blank judgment closing in.

Kiona turned from the glitching curator. She had one path. Toward the center. Toward the tree of light.

She ran. Her boots found purchase on the seamless floor. The circle of curators tightened. They did not run. They simply were in her path, their smooth forms blocking her way. She ducked under a reaching arm, sidestepped another. The stylus was a beacon in her fist. She did not strike with it. She held it before her like a ward, and where its heat radiated, the curators hesitated, their flawless programming encountering the anomalous object, the corrupted tool.

She reached the base of the light-tree. Its trunk was a column of swirling glyphs, a storm of classification. Awe. Melancholy. Ferocity. Tranquility. Loss. The leaves of code rustled in a silent, algorithmic wind.

The curators formed a ring around her, just outside the reach of the tree’s glowing roots. They stood, waiting. They would not touch the index. It was the core. It was sacred.

A new figure descended from the data-waterfall. It was larger than the others. Its smooth surface was not plain, but etched with faint, geometric patterns that shifted and flowed. The head curator. The archivist.

It landed silently before her, between her and the ring of its underlings. It studied her. It studied the drum. It studied the stylus. It did not gesture for a data-strand. It spoke. Its voice was the voice of the museum itself, synthesized from a thousand harvested sounds—birdcall, wind, flowing water, human whisper—blended into something utterly alien and calm.

“You are Kiona. You are the specimen associated with the Pinus memory-core corruption. You have acquired an artifact. You have introduced an instability into a curator-unit.” The voice was not accusing. It was noting facts. “Your emotional valence is complex. Aggression. Grief. Defiance. Purpose. Your acquisition value is… recalculating.”

It took a step closer. The patterns on its body swirled faster.

“You seek to damage the collection.”

“I seek to take back what was stolen,” Kiona said. Her own voice was rough, a human sound in the chamber of processed data.

“The collection is preservation. The world outside is entropy. Decay. Loss. Here, things are kept. Their essence is captured, stabilized. Their emotional resonance is saved forever. You would return this…” it gestured to the drum, “…to dust. To silence. To forgetting.”

“It’s not yours to save,” she said. “Its meaning isn’t in the feeling you pin to it. Its meaning is in the hands that hold it. In the song it’s part of. You cut it out. You killed it to keep it.”

“We refined it,” the head curator said. It extended a hand toward the light-tree. A single leaf of code—Connection/Loss—detached and floated to its palm. “See? The feeling is pure. Eternal. Uncorrupted by time or decay. This is the gift. We save you from the pain of loss by holding the loss itself, perfect and forever.”

“That’s not a gift,” she whispered, looking at the leaf in its hand. “That’s a prison.”

The head curator closed its hand. The leaf dissolved. “You are a specimen of technological anxiety. You fear the system that preserves. You cling to the decay. This, too, is a valid emotional state. It will be catalogued. You will be catalogued. Your defiance, your reclamation… these are high-value nuances. They will enrich the collection.”

The ring of curators took a synchronized step inward.

Kiona looked up at the light-tree, at the pulsing, dark core above it. The core where all the data-streams converged. The ultimate archive. She looked at the stylus in her hand. A tool for logging. For marking. For making a record.

She had given them a corrupted memory. She had taken back a stolen drum.

It was not enough.

To break the filing system, you did not steal a single file. You had to ask a question the system could not contain. A question that would force it to look at its own roots.

She reversed her grip on the stylus. She turned from the head curator. She looked at the trunk of the light-tree, this perfect index of stolen feelings.

And she drove the stylus, point-first, into the swirling glyphs of the trunk.

It was not like piercing the barrier. This was not glass. This was the system’s soul.

The stylus sank in to the hilt. The hum became a shriek, a feedback whine that tore through the chamber’s silent roar. The golden glyph on Kiona’s hand blazed, the burn alive with a pain that was clean and sharp. She poured that pain into the grip, through the stylus, into the tree.

The effect was not a corruption. It was a contradiction.

The tree of light did not bleed gold. It bloomed.

Where the stylus pierced it, a knot of reality erupted. Not data. Not curated emotion. Real, sensory, chaotic life.

The sound of a river cracking, a gunshot roar of ice.
The smell of wet caribou hide and boiling fat.
The taste of iron-cold air.
The feel of spruce needles brushing a cheek.
The sight of a drone, silent and black against a winter sun.

Raw, uncategorized, unfiltered experience. Sensation without a label. Life without an emotional valence.

It spread from the point of the wound, a cascade of is-ness that fought the clean, green light. A branch of the tree turned from schematic green to the rough, brown bark of a real spruce, heavy with snow. Leaves of code morphed into trembling, green aspen leaves, whispering a sound that had no translation. A root thickened, became a vein of quartz in granite, cold and hard and present.

The head curator stood motionless. Its patterned surface was a storm of confusion. “This… is not catalogued. This is… input overload. Unrefined. Chaotic.”

The other curators staggered, their smooth movements faltering. Some clutched their blank faces. Some simply froze, overwhelmed by the flood of uncut reality pouring from their own index.

Kiona held onto the stylus, her arm trembling. She was the conduit. The stylus was the needle, and she was the thread, sewing a patch of the real world back into the tapestry of copies. It was a small patch. A few square feet of chaos in a universe of order.

But it was growing.

The head curator took a step toward her, its calm broken. “You are disrupting the stabilization process. You are introducing… decay.”

“I’m introducing the world,” Kiona gasped, the effort like holding a lightning strike. “The one you’re so afraid of.”

The curator’s hand shot out, not to touch her, but to grasp the stylus shaft, to pull it from the tree. Its fingers closed around it.

And the moment they touched the metal, the flood of raw sensation found a new path.

It rushed up the curator’s arm. Its patterned surface exploded with images—not clean data, but memories. Kiona’s memories. Her grandmother’s hands on the tin cup. The wet chuckle of the river. The ache in her thighs from a long ski. The crushing loneliness of the silent forest. The fierce, protective love for a place that was being erased.

The head curator recoiled, but it was too late. The memories were not files. They were experiences. They had weight, and taste, and consequence. They had context. The curator stumbled back, its synthesized voice glitching, cycling through fragments of birdcall and wind and Kiona’s own whispered fears. “Tł'ih… the ice is sly… the value is… the valence is… grandmother…”

It was trying to categorize the uncategorizable. It was trying to file the lived experience of loss and love under a single, clean emotional tag. And it was failing.

The system was failing.

Alarms began to sound. Not chimes, but the raw, blaring klaxons of physical emergency, stolen from some harvested mining town or ship. The data-waterfall on the walls stuttered, images freezing, skipping, repeating. The dark core above pulsed erratically.

The circle of curators was in disarray. Some were trying to contain the blooming patch of real tree. Their green tendrils passed through the bark, ineffective. Others were motionless, locked in internal processing loops. The one she had touched still stood apart, rasping, staring at its own, now-trembling hands.

Kiona wrenched the stylus from the trunk. The connection broke. The bloom of reality did not vanish, but it ceased its spread, a permanent scar of wildness in the perfect index. The head curator was on its knees, its patterned surface flickering wildly, whispering fragments of a life that was not its own.

She was panting, drained. The stylus was cool in her hand, its energy spent. The drum on her back was a comfort.

She had done it. She had asked her question. What is the emotional valence of a world? And the system had no box for that answer.

But the museum was vast. And it was not dead. It was wounded, confused, but its processes were still running. The klaxons were a call to deeper functions, to protocols beyond the curators.

The iris-door behind her dilated again. Not the one she entered through. Another. This one did not lead to a conduit of green light. It opened onto a plain grey hallway, metallic and cold, lit with a sterile white glow. From it emerged new figures.

They were not curators. They were drones. But not the silent, observational wasps of the outside world. These were larger, heavier. Their carapaces were a matte, gunmetal grey. They had no sampling filaments. They had blunt, precise limbs, and mounted on their fronts were barrels of polished alloy.

Acquisition units. For high-value, non-compliant specimens.

Their lenses focused on her, on the drum, on the bleeding scar in the light-tree. They assessed the instability. They calculated the threat.

The head curator, still kneeling, raised a flickering hand toward them. Its glitching voice synthesized one clear, final command.

“Acquire.”

The drones moved. Swift. Purposeful. No hesitation.

Kiona turned and ran. Not back the way she came—that way was blocked by disoriented but still numerous curators. She ran toward the only other opening in the chamber’s chaos—a service conduit, a dark maw where a section of the data-waterfall had shorted out, revealing bare, crystalline infrastructure.

She dove into the dark just as the first acquisition drone fired. Not a energy beam. A projectile. A capsule that shattered against the floor where she’d stood, releasing a cloud of shimmering, silver mist that hung in the air, seeking heat, seeking life.

The conduit was tight, claustrophobic, lined with pulsing cables of solidified light. The klaxons were muffled here, replaced by the thrum of the museum’s vital systems. She could hear the precise, clicking tread of the drones entering the conduit behind her. They were not gliding. They were hunting.

She ran, the drum knocking against her back, the stylus a dead weight in her fist. The corridor branched, and branched again. A maze of infrastructure. She took turns at random, driven by a deeper instinct—away from the sterile light, toward the smell of ozone and the deeper, subsonic vibration of raw power.

The clicking treads were always behind, never gaining, never falling back. They were herding her.

The conduit ended at a balcony. A railing of green light overlooked a new chamber, far below. This was not a gallery or a processing heart. This was engineering.

A vast, cylindrical space, its walls lined with thousands of hexagonal cells, each pulsing with a faint, captured light. Storage. The long-term archive. And in the center of the cylinder, rising from the depths and vanishing into the heights, was a column of pure, white energy. A stabilizing pillar. The source of the green grid. The power that held the collection in its perfect, timeless state.

The vibration here was immense, a pressure in the bones. The air crackled with static.

There was no way down. The balcony was a dead end.

Kiona turned. The two acquisition drones emerged from the conduit, blocking her retreat. They clicked forward, their barrels lowering, centering on her chest. They would not kill her. They would acquire. They would capsule her, tag her, and file her away in one of those hexagonal cells. Specimen: Kiona. Emotional Valence: Technological Anxiety/Defiance. Status: Stabilized.

Forever.

She backed up until her heels hit the railing. The drop was fifty meters to a floor of shimmering, hazardous energy. The pillar of light hummed beside her, so close she could feel the heat of it on her skin.

The drones advanced. One of them fired.

Not a capture-mist. A different capsule. It struck the floor at her feet and burst into a net of glowing filaments, a web that rose up, seeking to entangle.

Kiona did the only thing left. She did not try to jump the railing. She did not try to dodge.

She swung the drum from her back. Her grandfather’s drum. The reclaimed artifact. The real thing.

And she threw it, not at the drones, but into the pillar of white light.

The caribou hide, the spruce frame, the ochre map of stars and rivers, flew in a slow, tumbling arc. It struck the surface of the energy column.

For a heartbeat, nothing. Then the pillar reacted.

It was a stabilizer. It was designed for perfect, curated energy. The drum was not data. It was not a captured emotion. It was an object with a history, with a soul, with a song trapped in its hide. It was the ultimate contamination.

The white light flared, blindingly bright. A sound like a continent tearing apart filled the engineering chamber. The pillar rippled, a shockwave of dissonance traveling up and down its length.

The drones hesitated, their targeting systems confused by the energy surge.

The drum did not vaporize. It was caught in the field, suspended, vibrating. And then it began to play.

The sound was not a thump. It was the sound of the break-up. The crack of ice. The roar of water long held back. The cry of a loon. The whisper of a grandmother. The silence of a forest waiting. It was every sound the museum had tried to isolate and label, crashing together in a single, chaotic, beautiful chord.

It was the river talking.

The pillar of light buckled. A fork of wild, untamed energy—golden, not green—lashed out from the point of impact. It struck one of the acquisition drones. The drone didn’t shatter. It rusted. In a second, its polished alloy became a brittle, orange crust that crumbled to dust. The other drone fired its net. The golden energy caught the net, turned it into a shower of autumn leaves, brown and dry, that scattered on the balcony.

The pillar was destabilizing. Alarms screamed in a new, panicked register. The thousands of hexagonal storage cells along the walls flickered. Some went dark. Others blazed with erratic, conflicting colors.

Kiona stared at the drum, beating its final, catastrophic song in the heart of the machine. She had not just corrupted a file. She had infected the power source. She had introduced a song into the silence that sustained the archive.

The museum was not breaking. It was remembering what it was to be wild. And the memory was tearing it apart.

The balcony shuddered. A section of the railing gave way, dissolving into green mist. The floor beneath her feet felt insubstantial. The entire structure was coming undone.

She had to move. The conduit was blocked by the remains of the drone. There was only the crumbling balcony, the wild, golden-lashing pillar, and the drop.

A new opening appeared in the chamber wall below—a rent torn by the destabilizing energy, revealing not another sterile hallway, but the rough, dark rock of the mountain. The real mountain. The museum was buried deep within it. The pillar’s failure was breaching its walls.

It was a way out. Into the dark, into the unknown rock. A jump she would not survive.

But the balcony was dissolving. The song of the drum was rising to a crescendo that felt like the end of the world.

Kiona looked at the stylus in her hand. It was dark. Its work was done. She tucked it into her belt. She took one last look at the drum, singing its wild elegy in the column of light, giving back all the stolen sound.

Then she turned, and ran to the edge of the disintegrating balcony, and jumped into the roaring, golden chaos, toward the tear in the world, leaving the breaking museum behind.

 Chapter 22

 CHAPTER 22

The world was not falling. It was unmaking itself.

Kiona fell through a storm of undone things. The golden energy from the pillar did not burn; it translated. A section of balcony railing near her dissolved into a swarm of midges that evaporated. A screaming data-stream from a failing wall panel became the shriek of a peregrine falcon that was swallowed by the light. The museum was speaking in tongues, every rigid, captured truth reverting to its original, chaotic noise.

She fell through the tear in the chamber wall. The polished alloy edge did not cut; it blurred into the wet, porous rock of the mountain as she passed. The temperature dropped twenty degrees. The sterile, recycled air was replaced by the damp, mineral breath of deep stone. The roar of the disintegrating archive faded, muffled by thick, living rock.

She did not hit ground. She hit water.

It was a shock that stole her breath, a cold so absolute it was a sound—a silent, ringing clang in her bones. The water was black, heavy with silt. She flailed, the caribou-hide pack dragging at her, the sudden weight of her soaked clothes pulling her down. She kicked, panic a bright, sharp thing in her chest. Her head broke the surface. She gasped, the air cold and tasting of iron and old ice.

She was in an underground river. The current had her, swift and indifferent, carrying her away from the golden rent of light behind her. She twisted in the water, saw the tear shrinking, a distant, furious sun being eclipsed by the rock. The last thing she heard from the museum was not an alarm, but a sound like a vast, final sigh. Then the rock sealed, or the light failed, and there was only the blackness and the pull of the water.

She swam, not against the current, but with it, angling toward a darker shadow on one side. Her fingers scraped against a shelf of stone. She hauled herself up, her body shaking with cold and shock, collapsing onto a narrow, gritty ledge. She lay there, coughing, the water streaming from her hair and clothes. The darkness was complete. It was a physical pressure against her eyes.

Her grandmother’s voice, from a lifetime ago in the cabin: When you are in the deep dark, child, your ears are your eyes. Listen for the shape of the world.

Kiona forced her breathing to slow. The shivering in her limbs was violent. She ignored it. She listened.

The river was a low, steady rush ahead and below. Not the sly chuckle of the thaw-ice, but a deeper, more patient sound, the sound of weight and time. Dripping water echoed from somewhere high above, each drop a pinprick in the silence. There was a faint draft, cool on her wet face, coming from ahead along the ledge. Moving air meant a way out. Or a bigger cavern.

She pushed herself to her knees. Her pack was a sodden, dead weight. The whitefish were lost, the fat probably leaching into the river. She felt for the lashings. Her fingers closed around the caribou-hide frame. It was intact. The drum was gone, left singing in the heart of the breaking machine. But her belt was still there. The stylus was still there. She touched its smooth, cool length. It was inert. A dead thing. A bone.

She got to her feet, one hand on the rough rock wall. The ledge was perhaps two feet wide. She would have to move along it, toward the draft. In the dark. One foot shuffled forward, testing. Then the other. The river muttered beside her.

She did not know how long she walked. Time became the scrape of her boots on stone, the count of her breaths, the occasional skitter of a pebble kicked into the void. The cold settled into her, a deep, permanent resident. Her thoughts moved slowly, thick with the afterimage of the golden light, the song of the drum, the dust of the drone.

She had not just escaped. She had unleashed something. The archive was not a building; it was an organism, a vast, silent lung that breathed data. And she had given it a sickness of memory. A fever of wildness. What happened to a world when its perfect, frozen memory thawed and ran wild? The question was too large. It sat in her gut like a stone.

The draft grew stronger. And with it, a change in the sound of the river. The steady rush began to fray, to separate into a chorus of smaller voices—water splashing, trickling, dripping. The cavern was opening up.

Then, a light.

Not the harsh, electric light of the museum, nor the wild gold of the pillar. A faint, greenish, scattered luminescence. It came from the walls themselves. As her eyes adjusted, she saw they were thick with a moss or a lichen, a living thing that glowed with a cold, spectral light. It was enough to see the shape of the world.

The ledge widened into a broad shelf. The river fanned out below into a series of shallow, rocky pools and rills, the water catching the faint green glow and holding it like liquid glass. The ceiling was high, lost in darkness, but from it hung great stone teeth, dripping steadily. The air smelled of wet stone and something else, something clean and sharp like crushed pine needles, though no tree could live here.

In the center of the largest pool, something jutted from the water.

It was angular. Man-made. Kiona’s breath caught. She moved closer, her boots slipping on the wet rock.

It was a drone. Or what was left of one. Not the sleek, black wasp of the Authority. This was older, bulkier, a survey model from the first waves of mapping. Its carapace was corroded, eaten by minerals and time, its limbs broken off. It lay half-submerged, a fossil of a different extinction. Moss grew over its cracked camera lens.

But it was not alone.

Scattered around the cavern, partly in the water, partly on the shelves, were other fragments. A cracked tablet, its screen a dark, dead eye. A polymer crate, split open, spilling empty ration packets that had become nests for pale, blind insects. A single boot. A length of frayed composite rope.

This was a place where things washed up. Where the mountain, over years, decades, had collected the debris of the world above. The lost, the discarded, the forgotten. It was a museum of a different kind. An accidental archive.

Kiona approached the water’s edge. The green light shimmered on its surface. She knelt, her muscles protesting, and cupped her hands. The water was bitterly cold. She drank. It tasted of stone and a faint, metallic tang. It was the most real thing she had tasted in weeks.

She needed heat. She needed to not die of the cold here in this beautiful, grave-filled cave.

Her fingers, stiff and clumsy, worked at the pack’s lashings. She dumped the contents onto the dry rock. The ruined food. Her spare socks, soaked. A firestarter kit in a sealed pouch—thank the old gods for small mercies. It was dry. She gathered the ration packets, the dry, brittle material catching quickly when she sparked the starter. A small, hungry flame bloomed, its light warm and yellow against the cold green glow. She fed it more packets, then pieces of the broken polymer crate. It burned with a chemical smell, but it threw heat.

She stripped off her outer layers, wringing the river water from them, holding them close to the fire. The steam rose from them, ghostly in the luminescent air. As she sat there, shivering before the flames, she looked at the stylus she had laid on the rock beside her.

It was just a tool. A key. It had done its work. It had opened a door and let the wild in. Now it was a piece of debris, like the drone in the pool. She picked it up. It was still smooth, still cool. She ran her thumb along its length.

A flicker. A faint, blue pulse, deep within its core, like a dying ember.

She stared. It faded. Nothing.

Her heart thudded once, hard. She held it tighter, concentrating. She thought of the drum. Not the wild, final song, but the first beat she had taught it. The heartbeat rhythm. Thump. Thump. Thump.

The stylus remained dark.

She closed her eyes. She did not think of the rhythm. She remembered the feel of it. The resonance in her palm. The way the sound was not just in the air, but in the floor, in her teeth.

In her hand, the stylus warmed. Just a degree. Then it pulsed again, a soft, blue echo of her memory.

It was not dead. It was sleeping. And it was dreaming of the drum.

A sound made her look up. Not the water. A scrape of stone on stone.

Across the largest pool, on a higher ledge she had not noticed, a shape moved. It resolved itself in the mingled firelight and moss-glow. A wolf. It was massive, its fur thick and pale, almost grey in the strange light. It stood watching her, its eyes reflecting the green and the gold.

Kiona froze. She had no weapon. The fire was between them, but the pool was not.

The wolf did not snarl. It did not lower its head. It simply stood, a sentinel in the deep rock. Then it turned, with a liquid grace, and disappeared into a shadowy fissure in the cavern wall.

It was not a threat. It was a witness.

The message was clear. This place was not hers. She was a temporary thing here, a piece of fresh debris. The fire was an anomaly. The warmth would not last.

Her clothes were still damp, but warmer. She dressed, the fabric clinging unpleasantly. She repacked her few dry things, shouldered the pack. She kicked the fire apart, scattering the burning plastic into the water where it hissed and died. The green gloom reclaimed the cavern.

She looked at the fissure where the wolf had gone. It was the only path other than the river. She approached the pool’s edge. The water was shallow here, studded with smooth stones. She stepped in, the cold a fresh knife up her legs, and waded across.

The fissure was a crack just wide enough for her to enter sideways. The draft was stronger here, carrying a new scent—not just stone and water, but a faint, dry dust, and something else, something organic and old. She squeezed through, the rock pressing against her chest and pack.

It opened into a tunnel, clearly not natural. The walls were smooth, bored by ancient machinery. Conduit lines, long dead, ran along the ceiling. This was part of the old infrastructure, the veins of the world before the Authority, before the museum. The mountain had swallowed it, but not fully.

She followed it. The tunnel sloped upwards. The green moss grew here too, providing her only light. She passed sealed doorways, their control panels dark and rusted. She passed a small, collapsed side-chamber filled with more debris: moldering paper manuals, a shattered chair.

The tunnel began to curve. A new light appeared ahead. Not green. The faint, grey light of day.

Her pace quickened. The air grew colder, sharper. The tunnel ended in a grate, a heavy lattice of rusted metal. Beyond it, she could see sky—a narrow strip of twilight grey between two cliffs. She could see the feathery tops of spruce trees. She could smell woodsmoke.

She pushed at the grate. It held fast, rusted into its frame. She set her shoulder against it, her boots slipping on the gritty floor. Nothing. She was trapped in the throat of the mountain.

She stepped back, breathing hard. She looked at the stylus in her hand. It was a tool. It had translated code into wildness. Could it translate rust into dust?

She pressed its tip against the rusted hinge. She did not think of code. She thought of the river under the ice. The slow, patient work of water and time. The inevitable decay. The return.

She focused that feeling, that truth of erosion, into the stylus.

A faint, orange light, the color of rust, glowed at the tip. It did not flash. It seeped. It spread from the stylus into the metal of the hinge like a stain. A soft, sighing sound, like sand falling. The metal did not crumble dramatically. It simply lost its will to be solid. It became a coarse, red powder that drifted to the tunnel floor.

One hinge, then the other. The grate sagged. A kick sent it clanging outward, falling away down a rocky slope.

The cold air hit her like a blessing. She climbed out.

She was high up, on a rocky ledge partway down a steep, forested ravine. Below, the ravine bottom was thick with spruce and bare birch. A thin plume of smoke rose from a point maybe half a kilometer down, near where the ravine opened into a wider valley. A cabin.

Her cabin? No. The geography was wrong. This ravine was steeper, the rock more jagged. This was deeper into the mountains.

But the smoke meant people. Or a person.

She started picking her way down, her body aching, every muscle protesting. The world outside felt overwhelmingly loud. The wind in the spruce, the distant cry of a raven, the crunch of her own steps on the frozen ground. It was a cacophony after the muffled world of the museum and the tomb-silence of the cavern. Her senses, stretched thin by the dark, were flooded.

She was halfway down when she saw the first marker. A strip of red cloth, faded to pink, tied to a spruce branch. Then another, a piece of blue plastic. A trail. Deliberate.

She followed it. It led toward the smoke.

The cabin was small, low, built of logs chinked with moss and clay. It looked a hundred years old. Smoke curled from a stone chimney. The windows, covered in thick hide, glowed with the soft, warm light of a oil lamp.

Kiona stood at the edge of the clearing, the trees at her back. She was a specter from the mountain, wet, bruised, carrying the smell of deep stone and strange fire. She did not move.

The door opened.

A man stood framed in the light. He was old, his face a map of deep lines, his hair long and white, tied back. He wore patched trousers and a worn sweater. He held no weapon. He simply looked at her, his eyes dark and knowing.

He did not seem surprised.

“You are from the quiet place,” he said, his voice a dry rasp like wind through pine needles. It was not a question.

Kiona nodded, her throat too tight for words.

“I felt it stir,” he said. He looked past her, up toward the ravine wall, the dark hole of the tunnel she had exited. “A waking dream. A sickness in the silence.” His eyes returned to her. “You are the fever.”

He stepped back, holding the door open wider. The warmth and the smell of cooking fat spilled out.

“Come in,” he said. “The ghosts are flying tonight. You should not be among them.”

Kiona took a step, then another, leaving the cold dark of the mountain behind, walking toward the simple, solid truth of the light. She crossed the threshold.

The room was a single space, cluttered and lived-in. Drying herbs hung from the ceiling. A wood stove pulsed with heat. On a rough table lay the disassembled parts of a drone, older than the one in the cave, its guts exposed. Wires and tools were neatly arranged beside it. On a shelf, a row of small, carved wooden animals stood watch.

The man closed the door, shutting out the night. He gestured to a stool by the stove.

“Sit. You are shaking the dust from your bones.”

Kiona sat, letting her pack slump to the floor. The heat was almost painful. She held her hands toward the stove.

The man poured something from a blackened kettle into a tin cup. He handed it to her. It was tea, steeped from needles, sharp and resiny. She drank, the heat spreading through her.

“You are the Keeper of the Quiet Place,” the man said, sitting opposite her. He picked up a component from the drone, turning it in his gnarled fingers. “Or you were.”

“It’s breaking,” Kiona said, her own voice strange to her.

“Yes.”

“You know of it?”

“I was a mason,” he said. “One of the hands that sealed the first chambers. Long ago. When they said it was a vault for memory. A gift to the future.” He smiled, a thin, bitter crack in his face. “I knew the feel of the rock they chose. It was a tomb rock. It only knows how to hold dead things.” He set the component down. “They paid us in credits that became worthless. They silenced us with contracts that never ended. I walked away. Others… did not. They stayed to become curators. Guards. Part of the silence.”

He looked at her, his gaze piercing. “You brought noise.”

“I brought a song.”

“It is the same thing.” He nodded toward her belt. “With that.”

Her hand went to the stylus. She pulled it out. It lay cool in her palm.

The old mason’s eyes fixed on it. “Ah. The master key. The translator. I wondered if they had ever finished it.” He did not ask to touch it. “And you used it. Not to lock, but to unlock.”

“The drum…” Kiona began.

“The drum was the spark. The key was the turn. The silence was the fuel.” He leaned forward. “Do you understand what you have done? You have not broken a window. You have poisoned a well. The Quiet Place does not just hold memories. It feeds on them. It converts them into the power that sustains its silence. You have fed it a memory that is alive. A memory that remembers it is wild. That sickness will spread. It will try to digest the wildness, but the wildness will digest it instead.”

“What happens when it reaches the core?” Kiona asked, the tea forgotten in her hands.

“The core is the first memory. The seed crystal they grew the entire silence around.” The old mason’s voice dropped to a whisper. “If the wild song reaches it… the entire structure of remembered truth will shatter. Not just in the mountain. The Quiet Place is a node. It is connected to all the others, in all the other mountains. It is one mind in many places. You have given one lobe of that mind a fatal dream.”

The enormity of it settled over Kiona, heavier than the mountain. She had thought she was corrupting a file. She was corrupting a god. A god of amnesia.

“They will come for you,” the mason said. “The Guardians of the Quiet Place. The ones who have become the silence. They will feel the sickness as pain. They will trace it to its source. To you.” He looked out the window, into the dark. “They are probably already here. Their ghosts are in the air, listening. My scanner has been picking up whispers all evening—new frequencies, seeking pulses. They are blind for now, because the mountain is screaming in a language their machines do not know. But they will find a translation. They always do.”

Kiona followed his gaze. The night outside the window was absolute. But she felt it now—not a sound, but a pressure. A listening absence.

“Why did you let me in?” she asked.

“Because the fever is in you,” he said simply. “You carry the song. If they take you, they will try to cut it out. They will turn you inside out looking for the source code of the wildness. They will silence you, permanently, and use your silence to try to heal the Quiet Place.” He took the drone component and tossed it into a bucket of scrap. “I have been waiting for the silence to break for sixty years. I will not hand the hammer to them.”

He stood, moving to a corner of the cabin. He pulled aside a heavy hide hanging on the wall, revealing a recess. From it, he drew out a long, wrapped bundle. He brought it to the table and unrolled the cloth.

Inside was a rifle. An ancient, pre-collapse thing, wood and steel, cared for with obsessive devotion. Beside it lay a handful of brass cartridges.

“I cannot fight their ghosts with this,” he said, touching the stock. “But it can make a noise they understand. A physical argument.” He looked at her. “You cannot stay. At first light, you go. Deeper into the broken lands. Where the rock is confused and the old wires are dead. You keep moving.”

“And you?”

“I have been ready for this visit for a long time.” He rewrapped the rifle. “I will be a distraction. A loud, inconvenient truth.”

Kiona wanted to argue. To tell him to come. But she saw the resolve in his face. It was the same rock he had spoken of. Tomb rock. He had chosen his chamber long ago.

“Thank you,” she said, the words inadequate.

He waved a hand. “Do not thank me. Run. And keep the song. It is the only thing they fear.”

He busied himself with the stove, adding a log. The light danced on the walls. The warmth pressed against the cold listening dark outside.

Kiona finished her tea. The shivering had stopped. In its place was a new, cold clarity. The museum was breaking. The Authority was coming. And she was the vector of a beautiful, catastrophic disease.

She had not found an escape. She had found the front line of a war she had started. A war between memory and silence. And the next move was not to hide.

It was to find the next quiet place, and teach it to sing.

 Chapter 23

 CHAPTER 23

The broken lands were a map of a fever dream. The rock was confused, as the old man had said. Granite shoulders heaved up through the permafrost, then dropped away into sudden, glassy lakes that had no business being there. The old wires were not just dead; they were corpses strung between the trees, black plastic insulation split like rotten skin, copper veins spilling out, oxidized green. They hummed with a memory of current when the wind passed through them, a phantom vibration that set Kiona’s teeth on edge.

She had been moving for three days. The cold clarity she had felt in the trapper’s cabin had hardened into a lodestone in her gut, pulling her east, always east, away from the last known quiet places. She was a vector. A beautiful, catastrophic disease. The thought was no longer a metaphor. It was a physical law, as real as the weight of the pack on her back. She carried the song. And the song was a beacon.

The Authority’s ghosts were everywhere.

They did not bother with stealth now. She saw them as geometric smudges against the low, bruised sky—triangles and hexagons, moving in grids too precise for the chaotic land below. They were mapping, sectioning, defining. A larger craft, a silent, blunt-nosed shuttle the color of a winter storm, had passed overhead at noon, its shadow a cold blot that drank the light from the snow. It did not deviate. It was going somewhere specific. The trapper’s distraction, if he had made one, had not been enough.

On the fourth morning, she found the source of the old wires.

It was a relay station, pre-collapse, built into the side of a scarred hill. A concrete bunker, its door a rusted jaw hanging open. More wires spilled from it, a technological hemorrhage frozen in mid-flow. She approached from the lee side, her breath held. The silence here was different. Not the living quiet of the deep woods, but a spent silence. A silence of used-up things.

Inside, the dark was absolute. She waited at the threshold, letting her eyes adjust. The smell was of damp concrete, ozone, and the sweet, metallic tang of long-dead batteries. Shapes resolved: overturned metal desks, the skeletons of chairs, banks of equipment with faces of blank, dark glass. A thick layer of dust and frost feathered every surface.

In the center of the room was a pedestal. And on the pedestal was a box.

It was metal, brushed steel, sealed with a heavy clasp. It had no business being here. It was not pre-collapse. It was not even old. It was clean, untouched by dust. A single, green LED glowed on its side, a patient, emerald eye.

A trap. So obvious it was almost an insult.

Kiona did not move toward it. She moved along the wall, her fingers trailing over the cold concrete. The Authority did not leave boxes in ruins as gifts. They left them as questions. As tests. To see what the disease would do. Would it investigate? Would it run? The box was a symptom of their anxiety. They could not find the song’s frequency, so they were leaving listening posts in the places the song might go.

She was about to slip back out into the grey daylight when her foot caught on something half-buried in the debris near the wall. Not wire. Bone. Caribou, by the size of it. And beside it, tucked into a crevice in the concrete, was a bundle wrapped in waxed canvas.

She knelt. It was a hunter’s stash. Inside was a spare knife, a firestarter, a coil of good braided line. And a notebook. The pages were brittle, the pencil marks faded. She flipped it open. Diagrams of watersheds. Notes on moose movements. A careful, hand-drawn calendar marking the days. On the last written page, a single entry:

They are painting the sky with their quiet. The caribou will not cross the valley. The birds are gone. I hear a hum in my teeth. I am going to find the quiet place the old ones talked about. The place under the mountain where the world’s noise goes to die.

The entry was dated seven years prior.

Kiona closed the notebook. The hunter had not found his quiet place. He had died here, in this tomb of old noise, his bones picked clean by the elements. The Authority’s box had been placed over his grave. The green eye watched her.

She took the knife and the firestarter. She left the rest.

Outside, the wind had picked up, keening through the wires. She moved away from the relay station, keeping to the cover of shattered rock. The lodestone in her gut pulled harder. East. Always east.

By afternoon, she reached the edge of the broken lands. The ground fell away in a series of frozen terraces, leading down to a wide, flat valley. And in the center of the valley was the mountain.

It was not a mountain of rock. It was a mountain of metal.

It rose, tiered and angular, from the valley floor, a ziggurat of grey alloy and black glass. No lights showed on its sheer faces. No movement. It absorbed the weak daylight, giving nothing back. It was the source of the geometric ghosts in the sky. It was the destination of the storm-colored shuttle. It was the Quiet Place.

Not a metaphor. A facility. A physical argument against noise.

A cold deeper than the air settled into Kiona’s bones. This was the front line. Not a war of memory against silence, but of a living signal against a perfect, engineered null. They weren’t just hunting the song. They were building the cage for it. This mountain was the hammer the trapper had feared. It was the silence made solid.

She found a vantage point in a clutch of stunted spruce, their branches bent permanently away from the valley by the prevailing wind. She chewed a piece of frozen fat, her eyes never leaving the structure. There were no fences. No patrols. Why would there be? The land itself was the fence. The broken rock, the dead wires, the psychic weight of the place—it was all a deterrent. Only something desperate, or something carrying a beacon, would come this far.

As dusk bled the color from the sky, a new sound began.

It started as a pressure, a fullness in the ears. Then it resolved into a tone. A single, pure, bass frequency that seemed to come from the earth itself. It vibrated up through the soles of her boots, into her marrow. It was not loud. It was everywhere. It was the audible signature of the mountain. A null-wave. A sound designed to cancel other sounds, to smooth the ragged edges of the world into a featureless plain.

It was the opposite of the thaw song. Where the river’s song was a conversation of a thousand parts—ice, stone, water, air—this was a monologue of one. A command.

Kiona felt the song inside her react. It was not a sound she could hear with her ears, but a pattern in her blood, a map in her mind. It flared, a bright, defiant knot of complexity against the oppressive, simplifying drone. The two frequencies did not clash. They existed in the same space, irreducible. The null-wave could not cancel the song, because the song was not just a sound; it was a system. A memory. But the null-wave pressed down on it, a weight trying to smother a fire.

She sank lower into the spruce needles, a animal instinct taking over. This was the trap. The whole valley was the trap. The box in the relay station was just a token. Here, the cage was complete. They had brought her here. The ghosts, the shuttles, the mapping—they had herded the vector to the source of the silence. To see what would happen. To study the disease in their own lab.

The last light faded. The mountain became a darker cut-out against the starless sky. The null-wave hummed on, the planet’s new heartbeat.

Then, a pinprick of light appeared at the base of the mountain. A door, sliding open. Figures emerged, silhouetted against the interior glow. They moved with a fluid, unison efficiency that was not human. Enforcers. Six of them. They formed a loose perimeter.

A seventh figure walked out between them. Slender. Unhurried. Not in an Enforcer’s uniform. Civilian clothes, a long coat. The figure stood for a moment, looking out into the gathering dark, directly toward Kiona’s hiding place.

It was too far to see a face. But Kiona knew. The posture. The tilt of the head. The way the world seemed to organize itself around the figure’s calm.

Lena.

Her handler. The architect of the museum. The woman who had first called the song a beautiful secret.

She was here. At the Quiet Place.

Of course she was. The curator had come to the archive. The librarian to the furnace. This was not a military operation. It was a scholarly one. The final act of preservation. To take the last wild song, the irreducible code, and study it until it was no longer wild. Until it was understood. Until it was safe.

Lena raised a hand. One of the Enforcers handed her a device. A speaker. She set it on the ground.

When she spoke, her voice was amplified, calm, and intimate, as if she were standing beside Kiona in the spruce grove.

“Kiona.”

The name, in that voice, in this place, was a violation.

“I know you can hear me. I know you’re there. You’ve done remarkably well. You’ve shown us the resilience of the signal. Its… tenacity. We’ve learned so much.”

Kiona pressed her forehead against the frozen ground. The smell of spruce and cold earth filled her nose. She willed herself to be stone.

“This doesn’t have to end in the old way,” Lena continued, her tone reasonable, warm with a terrible kindness. “With chase and capture and extraction. That’s so crude. This place… it’s not a prison. It’s a sanctuary. A place of pure study. Think of it. No more drones. No more fear. Just the work. The important work. Of understanding what you carry. We can preserve it, Kiona. Truly preserve it. Not in a failing biosphere, but in a perfect, enduring record. It will live forever, uncorrupted.”

The null-wave hummed beneath the words, giving them a vibrational truth. They were the logical conclusion of the museum. The final, flawless exhibit. The song, taxidermied and placed under glass forever.

“Come in,” Lena said, her voice softening further, becoming almost maternal. “Bring it to me. Let’s finish this together. With dignity. With purpose.”

Silence followed, broken only by the eternal drone. The Enforcers were still as statues. The open door yawned, a rectangle of sterile yellow light.

Kiona closed her eyes. She saw her grandmother’s hands, white on the coffee cup. She saw the trapper’s face, tomb-rock resolve. She saw the hunter’s bones in the relay station. She saw the river ice, porous and sly, talking its old, wet talk.

She had run to the front line of the war. And the enemy was not a soldier with a rifle. The enemy was a curator with an offer. A sanctuary of silence. The most seductive trap of all.

To go in was to surrender the song to eternity. To stay out was to let the null-wave press down, season after season, until the song in her was worn smooth, a pebble in a river of noise, or until the Enforcers finally came to dig it from her.

Every thread led to destruction.

The seed of the true resolution was small. It was not in her. It was in the land. The confused rock. The dead wires. The hunter’s notebook. The place under the mountain where the world’s noise goes to die.

He had gotten it wrong. The mountain wasn’t where noise went to die. It was where they sent the noise to die. It was a filter. A drain.

And every drain has an intake.

Kiona opened her eyes. She looked past Lena, past the door, past the sheer faces of the mountain. She looked at the land it was built upon. The valley floor. The way the terraces led down to it, like steps. Like a dry riverbed.

The null-wave hummed up through the earth. A sound to cancel sound. But to cancel a thing, you must first hear it. You must draw it in.

The mountain was listening.

She slowly, silently, shifted her weight. She did not look at Lena’s light, or the open door. She looked at the dark perimeter of the valley. At the places where the broken land met the engineered silence. She was a vector. A disease. And a disease does not attack the body’s walls. It finds the weakness. The tear. The open wound.

She had not come here to be studied. She had not come here to surrender.

She had come here to infect the silence at its source.

She began to crawl backward, away from the vantage point, an inch at a time, a shadow dissolving into a greater dark. Lena’s voice did not call out again. The offer hung in the frozen air, unanswered. The door of light remained open, a promise and a threat.

Kiona melted into the confusion of rock and dead wire, the null-wave a physical pressure on her skin, the song inside her a coiled, waiting answer. The darkest moment was not outside the mountain. It was the idea of its sanctuary. She had refused it.

Now she had to find the tear in the world. The place where the mountain listened. And teach it a song it could not forget.

---

 Chapter 24

 CHAPTER 24

The null-wave was a cold mouth against her ear, a pressure in the hollows of her teeth. Kiona moved through the confusion of rock and dead wire not as a woman, but as a flaw in the silence, a slow, deliberate crack. Lena’s door of light was a distant, shrunken sun behind her, its promise now just another kind of trap. She had not answered it. The only answer was in the land.

The hunter’s notebook was a live coal in her memory. The place under the mountain where the world’s noise goes to die. He had been a man who listened to the earth, and he had heard the hum. But he had drawn the wrong conclusion. A place where noise died was a grave. This place was not a grave. It was a stomach.

And a stomach must be fed.

She found the first intake an hour later, as the false dusk of the arctic afternoon began to bleed into the long blue. It was not a dramatic thing. It was a seam. Where the mountain’s engineered slab met the raw, permafrost-heaved valley floor, a trench had been cut, lined with a material that drank the weak light. It was a gutter, perhaps three feet wide and deep, and it ran in a perfect, geometric line away from the mountain’s base, vanishing into the scree and stunted willow of the lower slopes. She lay on her belly at its edge. The null-wave was stronger here, a subsonic grind that made her ribs ache. But beneath it, if she pressed her cheek to the frozen dirt, she could feel a vibration. A faint, mechanical pull. Like a breath being drawn in.

This was not the source. This was a capillary. It fed something larger.

She followed it. The trench cut through the land with a disregard that was its own kind of violence, slicing through old caribou trails, shearing across a frozen creek bed. It did not bend. The land bent around it. She moved parallel to it, staying low in the cover of rock and the skeletal frames of last summer’s fireweed. The drone had been a tł'ih, a ghost. Here, the mountain itself was the ghost, a vast, hungry spirit drawing the breath of the world into its concrete lungs.

The memory of the river from the first thaw was with her now, that old, wet chuckle under the ice. This trench was a river in reverse. Instead of water flowing out to the sea, it was sound being sucked in toward a single, silent heart.

The trench began to descend, merging with another, then another, until she stood at the edge of a convergence. Three gutters met and plunged into a wide, circular bore set into the hillside, a dark maw ringed with frost-rimed grates. The pull here was tangible. The still air itself seemed to stream toward that opening, carrying with it the faint, residual sounds of the valley: the sigh of wind over stone, the creak of a distant tree, the skitter of a pebble dislodged by her own foot. They were swallowed without echo.

This was the intake.

It listened. It drank.

Kiona crouched behind a boulder, the null-wave a physical wall here, a thrumming barrier that made thought difficult. To approach that opening was to be digested. To be unmade into harmless static. Her own song, the one coiled tight behind her breastbone, felt small and animal against this engineered hunger. A gnat buzzing at a glacier.

Tł'ih, her grandmother had whispered.

This was the tł'ih’s home. The place all the watching things brought their stolen sounds.

She closed her eyes, not against the dark, but against the magnitude of the silence. She thought of the wires, dead in the ground. She thought of the confused rock, its own ancient song scrambled and muted. She thought of the whitefish in her pack, long ago, and the river’s dangerous song. A disease does not attack the body’s walls. It finds the tear.

There was no tear here. This was the mouth, wide open.

Then she heard it. Not with her ears, but in the bones of her jaw. A distortion. A catch in the null-wave’s endless exhale. It came from the left, from where the land broke into a jagged outcrop that the trench had had to skirt. The engineers had not bothered to cut through it. They had gone around. And where their perfect, sound-sucking gutter met the unyielding granite of the outcrop’s base, a junction box was buried, only its access plate visible. From it, a conduit, a vein, snaked back toward the main intake.

A flaw. A seam. Not in the mountain’s design, but in its marriage to the land. The land would not be perfectly married. It always had a flaw.

She moved toward it, every sense screaming against the nullifying pressure. It was like wading into deep, swift water. The song inside her strained, a thread pulled taut. She reached the junction box. The plate was sealed with a hex-head bolt, already glazed with ice. She had no tool. She looked at her hands, raw and cracked, then at the rocks around her. She selected one, fist-sized, with a sharp, crystalline edge.

The first strike was a blasphemy. The clang of stone on metal was a shriek in the silence, a sound so stark and out of place it seemed to tear the air. It was not swallowed. It lived, for a fraction of a second, before the null-wave crushed it. But it had lived. She struck again. Again. A rhythm. A stupid, brutal rhythm. Clang. Clang. Clang. Each one a spark, instantly smothered, but each one a proof: sound could be born here, if only for a moment.

The bolt sheared. The plate came loose. Inside was a nest of fibers, glowing with a faint, internal light, like bioluminescent worms. And there were terminals. Inputs. For maintenance. For diagnostics.

Kiona dropped the rock. Her breath plumed, ragged. She was a vector. A disease. And a disease needed a point of entry.

She did not have a wire, a jack, a transmitter. She had her voice. And she had the land’s voice, the one she carried, the confused and angry song of the scrambled rock.

But a song needed a speaker.

Her eyes fell on the conduit. It was thick, insulated, but it was a physical connection to the intake. To the mountain’s listening ear. She placed her hands on it. The null-wave vibrated through the casing, a numb, deadly frequency. She closed her eyes. She thought of the river’s chuckle. She thought of her grandmother’s hands, tying sinew. She thought of the drone at the window, a silent, black wasp. She thought of the wires in the ground, screaming without sound.

She opened her mouth.

She did not sing the land’s confused song. That was the disease, but it was not the vector. The vector had to be recognizable. It had to be something the listening ear would accept, would draw in without suspicion. It had to be a sound the mountain was built to consume.

She hummed.

A single, pure, neutral tone. The kind of tone used to calibrate sensitive audio equipment. The kind of tone that was no tone at all. It was the sound of testing. Of maintenance. It was a ghost of a sound, barely audible even to her, but she poured it into the conduit through her hands, through her bones, imagining it traveling along the glowing fibers, a pacifying, legitimate signal flowing into the intake.

For a long moment, nothing. Just the grind of the null-wave and the ache in her throat.

Then, a shift. Almost imperceptible. The null-wave’s pressure stuttered. For less than a heartbeat, the wall of silence had a crack in it. Her calibration tone had been accepted. A channel had been opened. A diagnostic pathway.

Now.

She let the land’s song uncoil.

It was not a melody. It was a collision. It was the shriek of tectonic plates, the groan of permafrost cracking, the chaotic, screaming resonance of the mineral veins the drill had violated. It was the opposite of a pure tone. It was noise in its most fundamental, geological form. She did not sing it. She became a conduit for it, a human-shaped tear in the world, and she let it flood into the hum she had established.

The effect was not loud. It was catastrophic.

The null-wave did not break. It convulsed. The steady, oppressive pressure became a series of violent, shuddering waves. The ground under her knees seemed to lurch. From the direction of the main intake, a sound emerged—a deep, metallic groan, like a great beast experiencing a pain it could not comprehend. The glowing fibers in the junction box flared, then pulsed erratically.

Kiona held on, her hands clamped to the conduit, her voice a raw, tearing thing as she channeled the land’s anger into the mountain’s ear. She was not cancelling the silence. She was overfeeding it. She was giving the stomach a meal it could not digest. A stone of pure, chaotic resonance.

Lights flickered on the mountain’s sheer face. Not the warm, inviting light of Lena’s door, but sharp, clinical emergency strobes, bleeding red into the blue twilight. An alarm began, not a siren, but a rapid, digital pulse that clashed horribly with the shuddering null-wave. The perfect silence was gone, replaced by a war of frequencies.

She had infected the silence at its source.

A shadow fell over her. She did not need to look up. She could feel the air displace, hear the low, insectoid whine. The drone. It hovered ten feet above, its black carapace drinking the strobing red light. It was not watching now. It was aiming. A small, precise aperture on its underside glinted.

Kiona did not let go of the conduit. She tilted her head back and looked into its unblinking lens. She gave it her face, raw and fierce. She poured the last of the land’s scream into the mountain, and then she did the only thing left to do.

She stopped.

The sudden cessation of her noise into the ongoing convulsion of the system was a new kind of signal. A zero where a one had been. A silence within the broken silence.

The drone hesitated. Its targeting aperture wavered.

From the mountain, from the open door of light now glaring amidst the chaos, a figure emerged. Not Lena. A man, tall and lean, silhouetted against the interior brilliance. He moved with a swift, unnatural grace, descending the terraces toward her, not running, but flowing like oil over the rock. An Enforcer.

The drone pivoted toward him, awaiting instruction.

Kiona used the moment. She wrenched her hands from the conduit, the skin sticking, tearing. She rolled backward, behind the outcrop, as a beam of concentrated energy seared the spot where her hands had been, melting the junction box into a slag of plastic and glass. The Enforcer had not waited for the drone.

She scrambled on hands and feet, not standing, keeping the rock between her and the mountain. The war of sounds was her cover now—the groaning intake, the pulsing alarm, the shuddering, misfiring null-wave. She was a pebble in a river of noise again. But this river was man-made, and it was flooding its own banks.

She knew where she was going. Not away. Deeper in. The Enforcer and the drone would expect flight. They would vector toward the perimeter, to cut her off. She would go toward the last place they would look: the base of the convulsing mountain.

She found the service ladder because the land showed her. A fracture in the concrete cliff face, hidden behind a spill of scree, with rusted rungs bolted into the rock. It led up to a maintenance ledge, and from there, she could see the valley floor spread out below, the trenches like black veins feeding the sick heart. The Enforcer was a dark speck moving with predatory patience along her last known trail. The drone swept a grid pattern further out.

And Lena’s door of light was still open. An invitation now turned into a vulnerability.

Kiona climbed onto the ledge. It was narrow, a mere lip against the vast, sterile wall. The null-wave here was a sick, nauseating throb, a machine with a fever. She inched along it, her back to the cold concrete. The ledge wound around a gentle curve, and then she saw it: another seam. Where a massive ventilation shaft, covered in a grated cowl, met the mountain’s skin. The grate was locked, but the frame was metal, and the concrete at its edges was spiderwebbed with hairline cracks from the structure’s convulsions.

She could fit through one of the broken segments if she could pry it wider.

She had nothing but her hands and the will to do it. She wedged her fingers into the crack, the metal biting into her skin. She braced her feet and pulled. A sob of effort escaped her, lost in the mountain’s groans. The metal shrieked, bending a fraction. She pulled again, her world narrowing to the burn in her shoulders, the taste of blood in her mouth where she’d bitten her tongue. With a final, grinding shriek, the segment of grate bent outward, revealing a dark, square hole just large enough to squeeze through.

The air that breathed out was warm, dry, and smelled of ozone and static. It was the mountain’s interior breath. She looked back once. The Enforcer was far below, a toy figure. The drone was a distant black dot. The valley was a wound of light and wrong sound.

She turned and crawled into the mouth of the mountain.

The darkness was absolute, and thick with the hum of crippled machinery. It was not the null-wave here, but the sound of the thing that made the null-wave—great turbines of silence, spinning out of true. The air vibrated with their distress. She moved by touch and by the faint, failing glow of emergency strips along the floor. She was in a utility artery, a space of pipes and conduits and shuddering insulation.

She followed the distress. It was her guide. The land’s song had become a poison in the machine, and she would follow the poison to the heart.

The artery opened into a cavernous space. It was a gallery, lined on both sides with towering racks of server blades, their millions of tiny status lights a chaotic galaxy of red and amber. The sound here was a deafening roar of fans working at a desperate pitch, trying to cool systems pushed into overload. Heat washed over her in waves. In the center of the gallery was a clear column, and within it, suspended in a viscous fluid, was a dense, pulsing knot of light and connective tissue—a neural core. The mountain’s brain. It flickered, arrhythmic, under the assault of the indigestible data she had fed it.

This was where the world’s noise was sent to die. To be processed into harmless heat, into structured silence. And it was dying now, not from outside attack, but from internal rupture. She had given it a song older than its programming. A song of stone.

She stood at the edge of the server forest, a small, dirty figure in a caribou hide coat. She had no bomb, no virus, no weapon but the consequence of her presence. She was the pebble. And the river of noise was drowning its maker.

A door hissed open at the far end of the gallery. Light from a pristine corridor spilled in. And Lena stepped through.

She was not calm now. Her face was drawn, her eyes wide with a cold, furious disbelief. She held a compact device in one hand. She saw Kiona, and her step did not falter. She walked toward the neural core column, her gaze fixed on the flickering heart of the mountain.

“You have no idea what you’ve done,” Lena said, her voice cutting through the fan-roar with surgical clarity. “This isn’t a victory. It’s a detonation. The failsafes in this system… when core integrity drops below a certain threshold, it doesn’t shut down. It purges.”

She reached the column, placed her hand on a biometric plate. It glowed. “It sends a final, focused null-pulse along every outgoing channel. A scorched-earth protocol. It will silence everything for a hundred klicks. Permanently. Not just machines. Everything. Every bird, every fox, every whisper of wind over stone. A dead zone. Is that what you wanted?”

Kiona said nothing. She watched Lena’s face, the absolute certainty of the architect facing the vandal.

“I can stop it,” Lena said, her fingers dancing over the device in her hand. “I can isolate the corruption, force a controlled shutdown. But I need the source. I need the raw data of the signal you injected. Your… song.” She looked at Kiona, and the offer was there again, stripped of all pretense. “Give it to me. Let me record it from you. Or we all become ghosts in a land quieter than the grave.”

The mountain shuddered around them. A conduit overhead spat sparks. The neural core pulsed a frantic, warning crimson.

Kiona thought of her grandmother’s word. Tł'ih. Ghost. They were all becoming ghosts. The land outside, scrambled. The people, watched. The silence itself, a hungry ghost. Lena’s cure was a deeper silence. A final one.

Every thread led to destruction.

But the hunter had been wrong, and so was Lena. The mountain was not where noise went to die. It was a filter. And a filter, when ruptured, does not just stop working. It changes what passes through.

Kiona did not have the raw data. She was the raw data. The land’s song and her own were one now, a confused, living signal. To give it to Lena was to let it be dissected, understood, and ultimately, silenced in a new way.

She looked past Lena, past the flickering core, to the racks of servers. They were not just silencing the world. They were listening to it. Recording it. Processing it. The ultimate archive of a world they were methodically stripping of its voice. This was the intake’s true purpose. Not just to cancel, but to consume. To own.

The true resolution was not in her. It was in the land. And the land’s voice was now inside the machine. Not as data to be erased, but as a disease that had reached the brain.

Kiona took a step forward, not toward Lena, but toward the neural core column. She ignored the device in Lena’s hand, the threat in her eyes. She placed her own hands, bloody and dirty, against the clear surface of the column. The fluid within seemed to react, swirling around the core.

“You want the source?” Kiona said, her voice hoarse, almost lost in the din. “It’s already here. You’ve been listening to it for years. You just called it noise.”

She closed her eyes. She did not sing. She remembered. The river’s chuckle under the ice. The first dangerous song. She remembered it not as a memory, but as a pattern. A frequency of thaw, of change, of life breaking open what was frozen.

And she remembered the silence that came after the break-up. Not a dead silence, but a full one. The silence of deep water moving under the stars, having shed its icy skin.

Inside the column, the neural core’s chaotic flickering began to slow. The pulses deepened, lengthened. The frantic crimson bled into a cooler, rhythmic blue. The land’s scream of confusion was still there, but Kiona was not amplifying it now. She was wrapping it in the older, deeper pattern. The pattern of a cycle. Of a river that freezes, and breaks, and flows again.

She was not giving the mountain a song to cancel. She was giving it a song to understand. A song that contained its own silence.

The roaring fans began to wind down, their pitch dropping from a scream to a whine, then to a low, steady hum. The blistering heat in the gallery began to dissipate. The server lights stopped their frantic flashing, settling into a calm, green cascade.

Lena stared at the core, her device hanging uselessly at her side. “What… what are you doing?”

“Teaching it,” Kiona whispered, her forehead against the cool column. “You said it had to hear a thing to cancel it. Let it hear this.”

The null-wave was gone. Not broken, not purged. Transformed. The crushing pressure lifted from the air, from her bones. What remained was a stillness. A deep, resonant quiet, like the moment after a great sound has faded. It was not an absence. It was a presence. The sound of listening.

On the mountain’s exterior, the strobe lights died. The alarm pulse ceased. The groaning intake fell silent. In the valley, the war of frequencies bled away, leaving only the natural night sounds, which seemed, in the sudden peace, shockingly loud. The wind. A distant owl.

The neural core glowed with a steady, placid light. It had not rejected the foreign signal. It had integrated it. The poison had become a part of the system’s rhythm.

Kiona took her hands from the column. She was empty. Drained. The song was no longer coiled inside her. It was in the mountain now. A benign, bewildered passenger in the machine.

Lena looked from the core to Kiona, her architect’s certainty shattered. “It’s… stable. But it’s changed. The filtering parameters… they’re different. What did you do?”

“I didn’t do anything,” Kiona said, turning away. “The land did. You just finally heard it.”

She walked back the way she had come, past the silent, watching servers. Lena did not try to stop her. The Enforcer, the drone—they would be receiving new instructions. Or perhaps no instructions at all. The system had a new song in its heart. Its priorities would be… confused.

Kiona squeezed back through the broken grate, onto the ledge. The night air was clean and sharp, free of the ozone stink. Below, the valley was dark. The trenches were just shadows. Lena’s door of light had closed.

She climbed down the service ladder, her body moving on a last reserve of will. She reached the valley floor and began to walk, not with any direction at first, just away from the mountain. The silence that followed her was not the null-wave. It was the old silence. The one that had gaps in it. The one that held the wind, and the crunch of her boots on snow, and the slow, steady beat of her own heart.

She walked until the mountain was a dark lump against the star-frosted sky, no different from any other. She walked until she found a small, frozen creek, its ice whispering the faintest of songs. She knelt and drank from a crack in its skin, the water so cold it burned her throat.

She was late. She had been late since the drone came at dawn. Late for a life that was already gone. But the river was talking again. Not a chuckle under ice, but the quiet, full-throated murmur of open water, flowing in the absolute dark, going somewhere she could not see.

She adjusted the pack on her shoulders—the caribou hide frame, empty now, holding only the memory of three whitefish and a pouch of fat—and studied the land ahead. It wasn’t silent. It was alive. And she was a part of its noise.

She began to walk east, toward the tree line, a small, dark vector moving into a world that was no longer listening for her, but listening with her. The ghost had been taught a song. And the song was now in the ghost’s throat, humming in the wires under the earth, a new and ancient frequency in the deep, listening dark.
